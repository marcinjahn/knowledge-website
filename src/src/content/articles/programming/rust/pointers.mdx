# Raw Pointers

A raw pointer is a memory address without Rust's standard guarantees. They are 
unsafe, they can be null. Rust's references use raw pointers under the hood.

They are written as either `*const T` (immutable) or `*mut T` (mutable). One can be
casted to another.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a: i64 = 42;
    let a_ptr = &a as *const i64;
    println!("a: {} ({:p})", a, a_ptr);
}
```
