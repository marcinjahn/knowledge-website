# Traits

A **trait** is analogous to an interface or protocol from other languages. It
enables types to advertise that they use some common behaviour (**methods**).

All of Rust's operations are defined with traits. E.g., aaddition (`+`) is
defined as the `std::ops::Add` trait. Operators are just syntactic sugar for
traits' methods.

`a + b` = `a.add(b)`

## Defining a Trait

Here's an example of a trait that contains a `summarize` method. Any type that
has this trait needs to implement such a method.

```rust
pub trait Summary {
  fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}
```

We can also provide a default implementation:

```rust
pub trait Summary {
  fn summarize(&self) -> String {
    String::from("(Read more...)")
  }
}
```

:::tip
Default implementation can call other methods of the same trait (even if
they don't have default implementations).
:::

## Implementing Traits

A type may implement a trait as follows:

```rust
// type itself
pub struct Tweet {
  pub username: String,
  pub content: String,
  pub reply: bool,
  pub retweet: bool,
}

//Summary trait implementation
impl Summary for Tweet {
  fn summarize(&self) -> String {
    format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
  }
}
```

:::tip
We can implement traits only if either the type or trait are local
to our crate. We can implement traits on existing third-party types!
:::

To use a trait that has some default implementation (without overwriting it), we
can do it as follows:

```rust
impl Summary for Tweet {}
```

Or we could overwrite it, the same way as implementing a trait.

:::caution
Overriding implementation of a trait cannot call the default implementation.
:::

### Blanket Implementations

We can define methods for any type that implements some trait. It is similiar
to **extensions in C#**.

Rust does it with the `ToString` method, like this:

```rust
impl<T: Display> ToString for T {
  // ...
}
```

Thanks to it, any type that implement the `Display` trait has the `ToString` method

## Using Traits

### Function Parameter

Here's a function that expects any object that implements a `Summary` trait:

```rust
pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
  println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

or a full generic form:

```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
  println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

:::tip[Multiple Traits]
A function can also require more than one trait to be implemented on its parameter:

```rust
pub fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {}
```

or

```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {}
```

or

```rust
pub fn notify<T>(item: &T) where T: Summary + Display {}
```
:::

### Function Return Value

Functions can return types and specify just the trait of these types:

```rust
fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
    // return anything that implements Summary
}
```

:::caution
A function defined as the one above can return only **one type**. It
cannot return either one implementation or another.
:::

## Derivable Traits

Some traits (in the standard library and third party) have sensible default
implementations and they can be implemented on a type just by adding an
annotation `#[derive(SomeTrait)]`.

Here are the ones from the standard library:

### Debug

Writing `#[derive(Debug)]` before struct's definition makes that struct
printable in debug mode (`print!("{}", instance)`).

Another way to debug print is with the use of `dbg!(&instance)`.

### PartialEq and Eq

`PartialEq` allows checking equality with the `==` and `!=` operators.
Underneath there's just the `eq` method. The default implementation checks all
fields of a struct if they're equal.

The `Eq` trait has no methods.

### PartialOrd and Ord

Allows comparisons with the `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` operators. It can only be
applied to types that implement `PartialEq` as well.

In structs, all fields are checked.

### Clone

Allows creation of deep copy of a value. Default implementation calls `clone()`
on each field of the type. Cloning might involve copying heap data.

### Copy

Allows copying a value on a stack. All types that implement `Copy` must also
implement `Clone`.

### Hash

Allows creating some hash of an instance. The default implementation combines
resuts of `hash()` of all the fields of a struct.

### Default

Allows to create a default value for a type. It provides a `default()` function.

## Trait Objects

Trait Objects enable **polymorphism**.

Without trait objects:

```rust
pub struct Screen<T: Draw> {
  pub components: Vec<T>,
}
```

The `components` vector's items must all be of the same type. If we want to have
a vector that may contain values of any type (that implements `Draw`), we can
use trait object:

```rust
pub struct Screen {
  pub components: Vec<Box<dyn Draw>> // Box<dyn Draw> is a trait object
}
```

Now, we could apply the following code on top of that to make use of
polymorphism:

```rust
impl Screen {
  pub fn run(&self) {
    for component in self.components.iter() {
      component.draw();
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip[Pointer]
Trait objects must use some kind of pointer (reference or smart
pointer).
:::

This feature is a bit similar to what we can do in languages like JS (*duck
typing*), but different in the sense that the existence of required methods is not
done during runtime, and the code cannot panic due to some value not implementing
a required trait. It's safer.
However, Rust still needs to perform dynamic dispatch to find the code of the
method on values in runtime. This incurs some cost.

Trait objects may be used if in trait's methods:

- The return type isn't `Self`.
- There are no generic type parameters.

## Associated Types

Associated types allow traits to act a bit as if they were generic.

A real example from the standard library:

```rust
pub trait Iterator {
  type Item;
  fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}
```

The `next` method will return `Option<Item>` and the `Item` type is unknown
in the trait's definition. The types that increment `Iterator` have to specify
what `Item` stands for:

```rust
impl Iterator for Counter {
  type Item = u32; // concrete type
  fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> { ... }
}
```

:::tip[Generics]
Why not use generics then? According to the
[book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html), if we used
generics, anytime we'd call `next`, we'd have to call it like this:
`next<SomeType>()`, because generic type could be anything. Associated type may
be implemented only once per type (unlike generics), and the compiler knows
exactly which type `next()` should use.

Some traits use generics and associated types together (e.g. `Add`).
:::

## Supertraits

Some traits might require other traits also to be implemented by the types that
want to use it.

```rust
use std::fmt;

trait OutlinePrint: fmt::Display {
  fn outline_print(&self) {
    let output = self.to_string(); // comes from Display
    let len = output.len();
    println!("{}", "*".repeat(len + 4));
    println!("*{}*", " ".repeat(len + 2));
    println!("* {} *", output);
    println!("*{}*", " ".repeat(len + 2));
    println!("{}", "*".repeat(len + 4));
  }
}
```

In the example above, `Display` is the supertrait of `OutlinePrint`.
