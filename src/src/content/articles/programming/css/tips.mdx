# CSS Tips

## Resources

Generally about CSS layouts: [Smashing
Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/guide-css-layout/).

## Border-box setting

```csharp
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

## BEM

Naming CSS classes is hard. Especially in bigger projects. There are some CSS
naming systems. [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) is one of them and it's
quite simple. It focuses on defining:

- Blocks - something that can exist on its own (e.g., hero)
- Elements - something that is dependent on a containin block (e.g., hero__text)
- Modifiers - variation of something (e.g. btn--success)

Here's a [YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLjHSVwXYq4) about it.

## SASS

A good CSS preprocessor to use is [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).

## Media Queries

We can either design our sites mobile-first or desktop-first. Usually, the
latter is chosen (although the first option makes more sense nowadays). Then,
the media queries are created for mobile.

:::tip[Mobile-first]
The argument for the mobile-first design is that webpages are responsive by
default (images are an exception). Mobile websites look very similar to what we
get without layout styling. The elements are usually displayed as blocks, one
after another. That makes mobile design much easier to pull off. 

Obviously, another argument is that nowadays people use smartphones a lot.

### Tresholds

There are two main techniques for choosing breakpoints:

- looking at sizes of specific devices (like iPhone or iPad) - there are so many
  devices nowadays, that this might be overwhelming
- looking at our desktop-first site, resizing it, and just looking where it starts
  to look bad - probably a better alternative

It's also worth to remember that realistically:

- people are not going to change the size of the window too much while seeing the site
- some sizes are not going to be used

What that means is that probably it doesn't make sense to invest time into
making the site look great on every possible screen size. Just focus on the
realistic ones.

:::tip[Common tresholds]
Often poeple use **600px** as a treshold between mobile and above, and then
**900px** between tablet and above. Additionally, if needed, **1200px** and
**1800px** could be good choices for large monitors, if we want to display
things in special ways on those.

Here's a nice article with some reasoning:
[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-100-correct-way-to-do-css-breakpoints-88d6a5ba1862/).

:::danger[Viewport]
Don't forget to use the viewport `meta` tag, otherwise the media queries will
not work properly. Without, the website will zoom-out instead of being
responsive on mobile.
