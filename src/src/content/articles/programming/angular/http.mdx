# HTTP Requests in Angular

Angular comes with a built-in HTTP client. That's a difference compared to
Vue.js or React, which do not provide such tooling.

In order to use the built-in client, it needs to be imported into your module.
You need to import the `HttpClientModule`. With that in place, we can inject the
HTTP client into our classes, kind of similar to how we'd do in
[.NET](../dotnet/http-client).

```ts
export class MyComponent {
    constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) { }
}
```

The `HttpClient` has methods corresponding to actual HTTP methods, e.g.:

```ts {1,6}
httpClient.get<Person>('api.com')
    .subscribe(response => {
        // read response...
    });

httpClient.post<Person>('api.com', { name: 'Marcin' })
    .subsribe(response => {
        // read response...
    });
```

By default, all these methods return an `Observable`. We can use
[operators](./observables.md#operators) on them. [Error
handling](./observables.md#error-handling) is also the same as in `Observables`.

:::caution
The requests will actually NOT be sent out if nothing subscribes to 
the returned `Observable`!

We do not have to `unsubscribe()` from the observable, it's managed
by Angular.
:::

:::tip[Body]
Angular will serialize objects that should be sent as a body of the request
behind the scenes.
:::

Each method accepts an options object, which is the last parameter. There, we
can set things such as headers, query parameters, etc.

## Raw Response

By default, the subscrition returned when inoking an HTTP request, resolves to
an object representing the body of the response. In some cases, we might need
more data, like response headers or the status code. It can be configured via
the options object. Here's an example:

```ts
let sub = httpClient.get("api.com", {
    observe: 'response' // 'body' by default
})
```

:::tip[Events]
We can also observe `'events'` This one will bring multiple messages to
subscribers, informing about the stages that the request is at (e.g. `Sent`,
`Response`, etc.).

This seems to be the only useful use of `Observables` for HTTP requests, and a
very niche one. Otherwise, I don't really see why `Promises` wouldn't be
utilized by default.
:::

### Response String

Angular automatically converts the responses to JS objects. We can tell it not
to do it:

```ts
let sub = httpClient.get("api.com", {
    responseType: 'text' // 'json' by default
})
```

It can't be used iwth generic versions of HTTP client's methods, it wouldn't
make sense anyway, because the whole point of these generics is to automatically
get a typed response.

## Interceptors

Interceptors allow us to set up some global action on outgoing HTTP requests
and/or incoming HTTP responses. They work a bit like middleware in ASP.NET Core.
Interceptors are created as services implementing `HttpInterceptor`.

### Request Interceptors

```ts
export class MyInterceptorService implements HttpInterceptor {
    interpcet(request: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) {
        // do something with the request (log, attach some headers, etc.)
        return next.handle(request); // send the request further down the pipeline
    }
}
```

The `request` argument is generic. If we know the type of the respones, we can
use it here instead of `any`.

Here's how we register interceptors. In the module, we'd do:

```ts
@NgModule({
    declaractions: [ AppComponent ],
    imports: [ BrowserModule, HttpClientModule ],
    providers: [
        { 
            provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
            useClass: MyInterceptorService,
            multi: true // with this, we can have multiple interceptors
        }
    ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

What we're doing above is just the [DI](./services). We treat
`HTTP_INTERCEPTORS` as a placeholder for actual interceptors. Angular's inner
code asks for `HTTP_INTERCEPTORS` and it is given whatever we register.

:::tip[Multiple Interceptors]
Here's how we'd register multiple interceptors:

```ts
providers: [
    { 
        provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
        useClass: MyInterceptorService,
        multi: true
    },
        { 
        provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
        useClass: AnotherInterceptorService,
        multi: true
    }
]
```

The order of execution of the interceptors pipeline is the same as the order of
their registration.
:::

:::caution
In order to restrict the interceptor only to some sub-group of requests, we need
to filter requests out in the interceptor itself. All the interceptors are
invoked for any HTTP request.
:::

### Response Interceptors

Intercepting incoming responses uses the same kind of services as shown
previously. This time though, we need to makse use of the fact that the second
parameter of the interceptor returns an `Observable`. It is going to notify us
of the lifetime of the request.

```ts
export class MyInterceptorService implements HttpInterceptor {
    interpcet(request: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) {
        return next.handle(request).pipe(tap(event => {
            // do something...
        }))
    }
}
```

The `event` that we get access to is the same kind of event that was mentioned
in [Raw Response](#raw-response) section. We might want to filter out all the
events that are not of type equal to `Response`. The interceptor may modify the
response or do anything else with it.

:::tip RxJS tap
`tap` is an operator that allows us to do some action on every event, but it 
does not transform the event in any way (like `map` would do for example).
:::

## Promise

Instead of using `Observables`, we can utilize `Promises`, making it possile to
use `async`/`await` in our code:

```ts
let promise = httpClient.get<Stuff>('api.com').toPromise();
await promise;
```

## Best Practices

### Services

Instead of using `HttpClient` in our components directly, it makes more sense to
put that logic into some service. Such a service would work like a kind of
repository for a specific kind of data being fetched.
