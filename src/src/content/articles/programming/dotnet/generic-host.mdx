# Generic Host

Console apps or ASP.NET Core background tasks can use `IHostedService` to run.
Such apps are also perfect to run in:

- containers
- system services (e.g. via systemd)

:::tip[Kestrel]
Kestrel itself uses `IHostedService` to run!
:::

## IHostedService

### StartAsync

The `StartAsync` method of the `IHostedService` interface is async, but it's run
inline during startup. If the hosted service is a long-running one, it should
return a `Task` immediately and schedule the work on a separate thread. Using
`await` is also not recommended.

### BackgroundService

The `BackgroundService` is a convenient base class. It's designed to be used
with long-running tasks. It has just one method to override - `ExecuteAsync()`.
We can freely use `await` and never-ending loops (although we should be checking
`CancellationToken`).

### HttpClient and other non-singleton services

If our `IHostedService` implementation is long-lived we shouldn't inject HTTP
services there (e.g. typed HttpClients). `HttpClient` should be short-lived. We
could either use `IServiceProvider` to get new typed client in some interval
(service locator - not ideal) or use `IHttpClientFactory`.

:::tip[Singleton]
In general, `IHosterService`s are singletons. If we need to use some service
that is not a singleton from within, we shouldn't inject them directly. Instead,
we need to use some factory or `IServiceProvider` (to create scope for example)
to create the service repeatedly (usually the hosted service will run in some
loop with a delay).
:::

### Terminating the app

The hosted service can terminate the app when finished the execution. An
instance of `IHostApplicationLifetime` needs to be injected and used:

```csharp
_logger?.LogInformation("Terminating Application");
_applicationLifetime.StopApplication();
```

## Worker Service

Worker Service is a console app without the ASP.NET Core stuff.

We can easily create a Worker Service project with `dotnet new worker`. It
creates a simple `Worker` class that inherits from `BackgroundService` and
`Program.cs` that sets up `IHost`.

To get access to `IHttpCLientFactory` we need to add the
`Microsoft.Extensions.Http` NuGet package.

### Systemd

To turn an app into a systemd service, we'd install the
`Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Systemd` package. Then we'd call the
`UseSystemd()` method on `IHostBuilder`.

:::tip
Runing as a Windows service is similar, but different package/method combo is
used.
:::

:::tip[ASP.NET Core]
ASP.NET Core apps can be installed as services as well.
:::

### Quartz.NET

Quartz.NET is a scheduler library that enable some more advanced features of background services, like:

- CRON
- running multiple instances of it, with options to control concurrency (similar
  to RedLock)

It acts as a

## Manual Creation

We can also create the boilerplate manually.

### Imports

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

### Creating an `IHostBuilder`

Simple:

```csharp
private static IHostBuilder GetHostBuilder(string[] args)
{
    return Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
        {
            services.AddSingleton(hostContext.Configuration.GetSection("AppConfiguration").Get<AppConfiguration>());
            services.AddHostedService<InfluxCompleteSetupService>();
        });
}
```

With configuration:

```csharp
private static IHostBuilder GetHostBuilder()
{
    var builder = new HostBuilder()
        .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostBuilderContext, configBuilder) =>
        {
            configBuilder.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true);
            configBuilder.AddEnvironmentVariables();
        })
        .ConfigureServices((hostBuilderContext, services) =>
        {
            services.AddAllServices(hostBuilderContext.Configuration.GetSection("AppConfiguration").Get<AppConfiguration>());
        })
        .ConfigureLogging((hostBuilderContext, loggingBuilder) =>
        {
            loggingBuilder.AddConfiguration(hostBuilderContext.Configuration.GetSection("Logging"));
            loggingBuilder.AddConsole();
        });

    return builder;
}
```

### Running the application

```csharp
static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    try
    {
        var builder = GetHostBuilder(args);
        await builder.RunConsoleAsync(options => options.SuppressStatusMessages = true);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Program run into an exception");
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit");
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
```

.NET 6:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

try {
    using var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureServices((_, services) =>
            services
                .AddSingleton<InputReader>()
                .AddSingleton<BmiCalculator>()
                .AddHostedService<App>())
        .Build();
    
    await host.RunAsync();  
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Program run into an exception");
    Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
    Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit");
    Console.ReadKey();
}
```
