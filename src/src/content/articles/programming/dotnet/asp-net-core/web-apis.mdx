# Web APIs

Web APIs use the MVC framework of ASP.NET Core.

:::tip[APS.NET]
Before the Core, ASP.NET's MVC and Web APIs stacks were separate.
:::

The default `Program.cs` looks like this:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

var app = builder.Build();

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseSwagger();
    app.UseSwaggerUI();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

A controller example:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class WeatherForecastController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet(Name = "GetWeatherForecast")]
    public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get()
    {
        return Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(index => new WeatherForecast
        {
            Date = DateTime.Now.AddDays(index),
            TemperatureC = Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55),
            Summary = "Some summary"
        })
        .ToArray();
    }
}
```

The `ControllerBase` has a bunch of useful methods, like the ones that return
different kinds of `IActionResult`.

The `ApiController` attribute applies some useful conventions to the controller
(e.g. the usage of **ProblemDetails**).

:::tip[Controller]
There is also a `Controller` base class, but it's more useful for MVC
controllers that return Razor views (btw, [Razor Pages](./razor-pages) are a
better alternative).
:::

## Routing

We can use exactly the same templates as in the [Razor Pages
routing](./razor-pages-routing.md#route-templates). However, we speify those in
a different place - in the action's `Route` attribute.

```csharp
public class WeatherForecastController : ControllerBase
{
   [Route("")]
    public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get()
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

We can define multiple `Route`s per action. We can define `Route` on the
controller and the actions. In such a case, the action's URL is a combination of
these two. We can sign out of that by prefixing action's `Route` with a `/`.
Then, the action's `Route` is the URL.

:::tip[Token Replacement]
We can also include tokens `[controller]` and `[action]` in the routing
templates to include the name of controller/action in the URL.
:::

### HTTP Verb

Oura actions may also be marked with HTTP method to be used. We do that with attributes:

- `HttpPost`
- `HttpGet`
- `HttpPut`
- `HttpDelete`
- etc.

:::tip
These attributes can be used instead of `Route` since they also accept the route
template.
:::

### ApiController attribute

The following features are introduced with the `ApiController` attribute:

- complex action parameters are assumed to be `FromBody` and we don't need to
  use that attribute. By default, form would be expected.
- the `ModelState.IsValid` is executed automatically (via a filter) and 400 is
  returned in case it fails.
- The error status code are automatically converte to the *ProblemDetails*
  convention.

:::caution[ProblemDetails]
ProblemDetails payloads will be returned only if the request exection actually
goes into some controller's action. If an error is found earlier (or exception
is thrown in the action), the HTTP response will not follow the ProblemDetails
convention. One solution could be to use the
[Hellang.Middleware.ProblemDetails](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hellang.Middleware.ProblemDetails/)
package.
:::

## Returning data

We can return data from actions directly (e.g. `return new ["a", "b", "c"]`) or
we can return some `IActionResult`. In the first case it would be the same as
returning an `OkResult` with the `Ok()` helper.

### Formats

By default, ASP.NET Core returns data in JSON format. We can change that by
adding additional providers. For example, to add `text/xml` support:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddControllers().AddXmlSerializerFormatters();
```

:::tip
The same way, we can also add input providers to support different kinds of
formats in requests.
