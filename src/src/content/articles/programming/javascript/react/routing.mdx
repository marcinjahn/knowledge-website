# React Routing

## Packages

```bash
npm i react-router-dom
npm install @types/react-router-dom
```

## Usage

### Enable routing

In `src/index.ts`:

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

### Add routing

In `App.tsx`:

```html
<Container style={{ marginTop: "7em" }}>
    <Route exact path="/" component={HomePage} />
    <Route path="/activities" component={ActivityDashboard} />
    <Route path="/activities/:id" component={ActivityDetails} />
    <Route path="/createActivity" component={ActivityForm} />
</Container>
```

React-router displays the first route which satisfies the path, even aprtially,
that's why adding `exact` parameter to the first route is needed.

The third route has a path parameter "id".

#### Conditional rendering

Sometimes we not only want to render some component in fixed place based on
routing, but possibly we want to display different page layout based on routing.
We can then use `Route` inside of another `Route`:

```html
return (
    <Fragment>
      <Route exact path="/" component={HomePage} />
      <Route path="/(.+)" render={() => (
          <Fragment>
            <NavBar />
            <Container style={{ marginTop: "7em" }}>
              <Route exact path="/activities" component={ActivityDashboard} />
              <Route path="/activities/:id" component={ActivityDetails} />
              <Route
                key={location.key}
                path={["/createActivity", "/manage/:id"]}
                component={ActivityForm}
              />
            </Container>
          </Fragment>
        )}
      />
    </Fragment>
);
```

if we navigate to `/` we will display ONLY `HomePage`. If we navigate to
anything else, we will display appropriate component under a `NavBar`.
`path="/(.+)"` checks if there is anything after `/`.

### Loading just one route

It might happen that a few routes satisfy the path. We might use `Swicth`
component around our routes to make sure that only one route is loaded.

```html
<Switch>
    <Route exact path="/activities" component={ActivityDashboard} />
    <Route path="/activities/:id" component={ActivityDetails} />
    <Route
      key={location.key}
      path={["/createActivity", "/manage/:id"]}
      component={ActivityForm}
    />
    <Route component={NotFound} />
</Switch>
```

It's also a good practice to have a route to "Not Found" page at the end. It's
without a path, because it should "catch" anything that wasn't caught by
previous routes.

### Navigation using components

There are two components to be used:

- `Link`
- `NavLink` - like `Link`, but can add styling

Sometimes it's useful to rended other components as `Link`. Example:

```js
<Menu.Item name="Activities" as={Link} to="/activities" />
```

`Menu.Item` (Semantic UI somponent) will appear as normal, however it will
become a link to "/activities".

With `NavLink`, "active" clas will be set automatically when clicked on a
`Menu.Item` (class name can be changed, for Semantic UI "active" is correct).

```js
<Menu.Item header as={NavLink} exact to="/">
```

Again, `exact` property is needed if we want to highlight only the correct
thing.

### Route props

When we use router, components have access to additional props, which have
various functionalities, i.e. it shows path parameters:

If we want to use some custom path parameters that our component is supposed to
receive in URL (like id), we need to create interface for contents of `params`:

```js
interface IDetailParams {
  id: string;
}
```

Component then needs to be typed. `RouteComponentProps` is generic:

```js
const ActivityDetails: React.FC<RouteComponentProps<IDetailParams>> 
```

`IDetailParams` should contain data that will be in `match.params`.

### Navigation using code

One of the props we get is `history`. It has various methods like `goBack()`,
`goForward()`, `push()`, etc. We can use those to navigate.

```html
<Button
    content="Cancel"
    onClick={() => history.push('/activities')}
/>
```

### Adding router props to root component

If a component was not render by router, we can add routing additions
(additional props like `history`), by using `withRoute` higher order function:

```js
export default withRouter(observer(App));
```

In this case we're also using `observer` from MobX.

### Other tips

Router keeps same scrollbar position when routing to different pages. It can be
undesired.
