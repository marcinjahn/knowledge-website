# TypeScript Tips

## Typing

When creating types it's good to use interfaces instead of classes. Difference
is that interface is not going to be transpiled to JavaScript, which results in
a shorter JS code.

Example:

```js
export interface IActivity {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    category: string;
    date: Date;
    city: string;
    venue: string;
}

```

## Properties Declaration

We can quickly declare some class properties and make them settable via a
constructor like this:

```ts
export class Ingredient {
  constructor(public name: string, public amount: number) {}
}
```

## never type

There's a `never` type. It's a bit similar to `void` in the sense that the user is not expected to use the value of that type. The distintion is:

- functions that return `void` actually return `undefined`
- functions that return `never` are programmed in a way that they never actually
  return. They could always throw some exception or they might be just infinite.
