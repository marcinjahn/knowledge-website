# Solidity

One of the languages supported by Ethereum is **Solidity**. It is updated quite
frequently, breaking changes should be expected.

Solidity is used for the creation of **smart contracts**.

A simple program:

```sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.11;
contract Counter {
    uint value;

    function initialize(uint x) public {
        value = x;
    }

    function get() view public returns (uint) {
        return value;
    }

    function increment(uint n) public {
        value = value + n;
    }

    function decrement(uint n) public {
        value = value - n;
    }
}
```

A deployed smart contract is accessible to anyone who has an identity on the
blockchain (human or a program).

## Features

### Data types

- `address` - refers to identity of participants
- `struct` - allows creation of structures of data
- `mapping` - defines a dictionary/map/hashtable
- `enum` - enumeration
- `array` - e.g. `Proposal[] proposals;`

#### Structs

Example

```solidity
struct Voter {
    uint weight;
    bool voted;
    uint vote;
}
```

#### Enums

Example:

```solidity
enum Phase {Init, Regs, Vote, Done}
Phase public state = Phase.Init;
```

### Loops

Loops looks like in C. If the content is just one-line ling, curly brackets may
be skipped.

```solidity
for (uint prop = 0; prop < numProposals; prop++) {
    proposals.push(Proposal(0));
}
```

### Functions

```solidity
function changeState(Phase x) public {
    // content...
}
```

#### Storage

Variables within functions may either end up in the blockchain or not. Simple
variables, by default, are not recorded on the blockchain. Structs are recorded
(by default). We can change that behavior with keywords:

- `memory` - variable is not stored
- `storage` - variable is stored

Example:

```solidity
Voter memory sender = voters[msg.sender];
```

`Voter` is a struct. By adding the `memory` keyword, we made the variable
temporary. It will not be stored on the blockchain.

#### View Functions

If a function is marked with a `view` keyword, it is not allowed to modify the
state and its execution is not recorded on the blockchain.

If `view` is missing, every invocation is recorded in the ledger.

#### Returning data

Functions may return data. In such a case, we may define a variable that will
be returned and write some data into it.

```solidity
function myFunc() returns (uint someData) {
    someData = 4;
}
```

### Constructor

A contract might have a constructor. It is run during the deployment of the contract
to the blockchain. The deployment is done by some participant of the blockchain.
The deployment may be performed with some ethers attached. These ethers are added
to the contact's funds. It's no different from other functions' execution. These can
also accept funds.

```solidity
constructor (uint numProposals) {
    chairperson = msg.sender;
    voters[chairperson].weight = 2;

    for (uint prop = 0; prop < numProposals; prop++) {
        proposals.push(Proposal(0));
    }
}
```

### Visiblity Modifiers

Dat and functions may be defined as `public`, making them reachable by the
public. Without that keyword, the data/function is internal to the contract and
may be called only within that contract.

It's analogical to encapsulation in the OOP.

### Access Modifiers

They are used to guard access to data/functions. They are similar to functions.

```solidity
modifier validPhase(Phase reqPhase) {
    require(state == reqPhase);
    _;
}
```

:::tip[Parameters]
The modifier above accepts a parameter. A modifier might be defined without any
parameters.
:::

The `_;` invokes the actual function that is guarded by the modifier.
(can we do some actions in the modifier post function execution?)

To use a modifier, we need to state it in the "header" of a function, like this:

```solidity
function register(address voter) public validPhase(Phase.Regs) {
    // ...
}
```

The function above will invoke the modifier with the value `Phase.Regs` (it's an
enum) passed to it. Only if that modifier succeeds, the transaction may be
registered.

:::tip[Multiple modifiers]
Multiple modifiers may be applied to a single function. They are executed in the
same sequence as they are listed on a function.

If any of the modifiers in a chain fails, the rest will not be executed.
:::

### Payable

A function with the `payable` keyword accepts payments (in `msg.value`).

### Sender

Every function invocation has access to the `msg.sender` field that reveals the
address of the caller.

### Built-in functions

#### Revert

If something is wrong in the execution (e.g., some validation failed),
`revert()` reverts the transaction. Revert is called automatically by the Smart
Contract in case of runtime error.

In case of a revert, all changes done during the execution are reverted.

:::tip
A reverted transaction is not recorded on the blockchain.
:::

#### Require

`require(condition)` is a basic assert operation used for validation. If the
provided condition if false, `revert()` will be called.

`require` does not consume all the remaining gas offered to pay (like `assert`
does). It should be used in cases where the condition being false is a normal
situation that is expected to happen (e.g., when validating user inputs).

It's useful in access modifiers.

#### Assert

`assert(condition)` works basically the same as `require`, but it uses up all
the remaining *gas*.

It should be used when checking conditions that are crucial and are not expected
to ever be false.

### Events

Smart contracts may define and emit events.

A definition example:

```solidity
event AuctionEnded(address winner, uint highestBid);
```

Emitting example:

```solidity
emit AuctionEnded(highestBidder, highestBid);
```

:::caution[Parameters limit]
Maximum three parameters may be used in an event.
:::

Events are stored on the blockchain in the block's receipt tree.
These events can be retrieved by dapps.

## Remix IDE

It's a web-based IDE for Solidity. It can be found at
[https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/). It's suitable for
playground/learning scenarios. Production apps should use something like
Truffle.
