# Helm

**Helm** is a package manager for Kubernetes. The packages themselves are called
**Charts**. Installed chart is called a **Release**.

## Why?

- Typically, K8s applications require multiple objects: deployments, services,
  ingresses, storage, configs, etc. Usually, these are defined in separate YAML
  files.
    - we'd like to treat these objects "atomically" - they are all parts of one app
    - the order of objects creation might matter (e.g. config before deployment)
    - versioning is not straightforward - we have to remember the differences
      between two versions and manually apply them

With Helm, we get the following:

- We treat the app as a single entity, "forgetting" that it consists of multiple
  objects - an app in a **package**
- Packages are versioned, making it much easier to upgrade/downgrade apps
- Templates allow extracting variables from YAML files for customizability
- Management of dependencies

## Helm Charts

A **Chart** is a package.

### Structure

A chart is an archive containing a single folder:

```
my-chart
|  charts (optional)
|  |  mongodb-7.8.4.tgz
|  Chart.yaml
|  README.md
|  requirements.yaml (optional)
|  templates
|  |  deployment.yaml
|  |  _helpers.tpl
|  |  ingress.yaml
|  |  service.yaml
|  |  NOTES.txt
|  .helmignore
|  values.yaml
|  values.schema.json
```

:::tip
Files in `/templates` prefixed with `_`  are not rendered as manifests.
:::

- the name of the folder is the name of the chart. 
- the `Chart.yaml` contains metadata about the chart (like a version, dependencies, etc.)
- dependencies can be also included as sub-charts, inside of the `charts`
  folder, or listed in the `requirements.yaml` (see note below)
- the `templates` folder contains customizable YAML files (or just "normal"
K8s-ready YAMLs if customization is not needed).
- the documentation should be placed in the `README.md` file
- the message to be displayed after chart installation should be placed in the
  `templates/NOTES.txt` file. It is a template, so it can make use of
  placeholders to dynamically include some values.
- the template values can be specified in the `values.yaml` file. It contains
  the default values.
- the `values.schema.json` file defines the structure of the `values.yaml` file
  as JSON schema
- the `.helmignore` file allows us to specify files that should be ignored by
  Helm during templates processing
- the `_helpers.tpl` file is often used to store user-defined functions/snippets

:::caution[requirements.yaml]
The `requirements.yaml` file is supported, but it's not a recommended way of
adding dependencies. They should be listed in the `Chart.yaml` file nowadays.
:::

An example of `Chart.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: my-chart
description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes
keywords:
  - demo
type: application
version: 0.1.0 # SemVer 2.0
appVersion: 1.16.0
dependencies:
  ...
```

#### Umbrella Chart

Some charts might be more complex, and they might contain a few major
components, like a frontend, a backend, and a database. Each of these is a
separate part of the application, with its own set of YAMLs. We can define them
as separate charts, and then place them inside of the `charts` directory of the
"umbrella" chart - a chart that brings the sub-components together.

![](../../../../assets/umbrella-chart.png)

Each sub-chart may contain its own `values.yaml` file. The umbrella chart's
`value.yaml` may overwrite the sub-chart's values.

The values defined in the sub-charts can also be made available to the parent
child. The sub-chart has to `export` values, and the parent's `values.yaml` has
to `import-values`. There is also a way that does not require the sub-chart to
define values inside of `export`. This functionality, in general, is rarely
used, so I'm not describing it here.

### Types

Not all charts are apps. Some charts act as libraries of functions for other
charts to consume. We can denote it by specifying `type: library` in the
`Chart.yaml` file. Applications use `type: application` instead.

### Versioning

The `Chart.yaml` file specifies multiple version strings:

- `apiVersion` - v2 is for Helm 3 (obviously)
- `appVersion` - version of the app to be installed
- `version` - version of the chart itself

An example: We could be preparing a chart for Discourse. The version of
Discourse to be deployed could be "2.8.0.beta1". That would be the `appVersion`.
Chart version could be `0.0.1` - `version`. If I change something in the charts
(e.g. enhance the deployment properties somehow), I'd increment the `version`
property. The `appVersion` would not change (unlesss a new version of Discourse
came up and I wanted to include it in my chart as well).

Can I change `appVersion` without changing the `version`? I think that I
shouldn't be able to do so.

Can I upgrade a release to a chart with major version change? A major change
means breaking changes, so I am not able to upgrade?

### Releases

A **Release** is an installed chart on some cluster. Usually, we install a chart
once, creating a single release. However, we could also install a chart multiple
times creating multiple instances in a single cluster (e.g. "dev" and "test"
environments or multiple instaces of some app, like a DB, for completely
different purposes).

#### Release Revision

We can update a deployed release. It can be due to:

- desire to upgrade to a different version of the chart
- change in some values of the release

We can upgrade existing release to a new revision with `helm upgradae {release}
{chart}`. We can also go back in history with `helm rollback {release}
{revision}`. We can print the history of revisions with `helm history {release}`.

## Templating

Helm allows us to prepare YAML files with placeholders for values - these are
templates. Thanks to that, releases can be customized. Some values specified by
the chart author can be replaced, while others could use the default values.

The placeholders in templates are wrapped in `{{}}`.

The placeholders in the templates are replaced with values when running Helm CLI
commands (like `install` or `upgrade`).

:::tip
Helm's template engine is based on the Go Template engine.
:::

### Example

Template (for a service):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: {{ .Release.Name }}-{{ .Chart.Name }}
    labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
spec:
    type: {{ .Values.service.type }}
    ports:
        - port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
          targetPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
```

`values.yaml`:

```yaml
service:
    type: ClusterIP
    port: 80
```

### Sources of Data

Values for the templates can be supplied from various sources:

- `.Values`:
  - `values.yaml` - chart's author places default values there
  - command line parameters (e.g. `helm install --set foo=bar`) - overwrites data
    from `values.yaml`
  - any other YAML file (then we need to specify it in the `helm install -f
    some-file.yaml` command) - overrided values in `values.yaml`
- `Chart.yaml` - placeholder starts from `.Chart.`
- other files - placeholder start from `.Files.Get {file-name}`
- Template file itself - placeholder starts from `.Template.`.
- Release runtime data - template starts from `.Release.` (e.g. `Release.Name`,
  `Release.Revision`).
- Cluster metadata - template starts from `.Capabilities` (e.g.
  `Capabilities.KubeVersion`)

:::tip[PascalCase]
Even though the properties in the files could be in camelCase, in the templates
we have to refer to them in the PascalCase.
:::

The `values.yaml` can be as convoluted as needed (it can contain objects, arrays).
In the templates we can refer to these values. Examples:

- `.Values.service.name`
- `.Values.service.names[0].displayName`

:::tip[Globals]
If we define some data within the `global` key of `values.yaml`, the data will
be available in any sub-chart under `.Values.global`.
:::

#### Schema

If we define the schema in the `values.schema.json` file, Helm will validate the
`values.yaml` file before doing any actual operation (like `install`).

### With scope

In our template, we could have lots of repetitions in our placeholders (e.g. all
of them starting with `.Values.config`). In such a case, we could use `with` to
specify that prefix just once:

```yaml
spec:
  {{ with .Values.config }}
  type: {{ .type }} # .Values.config.type
  ports:
    - port: {{ .port }} # .Values.config.port
      tagetPort: 80
  {{ end }}
```

:::caution[New Lines]
The "with" and `end` cause the resulting manifests to have
additional newlines added in their place, which might be an issue. It can be
solved with `-`, which removes new lines.
:::

:::caution
Inside of the "with" scope, we cannot refer to anything outside of that scope.
We have to use [Variables](#variables).
:::

### Dry Run

We can see how the templates will be turned into manifests with the `helm
template {chart-name}` command (it doesn't even require K8s cluster connection).

We can also use the `helm install {release-name} {char-name} --dry-run --debug`.

### Logic

We may use functions in the templates when some additional logic is needed.
There are 2 syntaxes:

- function - `quote(value)`
  - arguments separated by commas
- pipeline - `value | quote` 
  - arguments separated by spaces, and placed after
  the function - `first_arg | fn other_arg`

Functions come from:

- Go templates
- Sprig project
- Helm itself

#### Function Examples

- `default` - returns a value if exists, if not, returns some provided default
- `quote` - adds quotes
- `upper` - transforms to upper-case
- `b64enc` - encodes to base64
- `trunc` - truncates value to specified amount of characters (useful for
  labels, which are limited to 63 characters)

Operators are also functions:

- `eq`
- `ne`
- `gt`
- `and`
- etc.

#### Conditionals

```jsx
{{ if and .adminEmail (or .serviceAccountJson .existingSecret) }}
``` 

It translates to: "if (adminEmail AND (serviceAccountJson OR existingSecret))"

Example of usage:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name:
{{- if .Values.service.name -}} # - removes newline
{{ .Values.service.name | trimSuffix "- "}}
{{- else -}}
{{ .Chart.Name }}
{{- end -}}
```

We can build the manifest differently depending on some values.

#### Loops

An example:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
spec:
{{- range .Values.ingress.hosts }}
  - host: {{ .hostname | quote }}
    http:
      paths:
      {{- range .paths }}
        - path: {{ .path }}
          backend:
            serviceName: {{ .service }}
            servicePort: http
      {{- end }}
{{- end}}
```

`values.yaml`:

```yaml
ingress:
  hosts:
    - hostname: frontend.local
      paths:
        - path: "/public"
          service: "frontend"
        - path: "/admin"
          service: "admin"
    - hostname: backend.local
      paths: []
```

:::caution
Inside of the loop, we cannot refer to anything outside of the range's scope.
We have to use [Variables](#variables).
:::

#### Variables

Variables allow us to define values within templates and name them. They are
useful when using the "with" scoping or loops, since within these we cannot
refer to anything outside of their scope. However, we can refer to variables.

```yaml {1,8}
{{ $defaultPortName := .Values.defaultPortName }} # variable definition
spec:
  {{ with .Values.config }}
  type: {{ .type }}
  ports:
    - port: {{ .port }}
      tagetPort: 80
      name: {{ $defaultPortName }} # we use a variable to get a value outside of .Values.config, that we're scoped to
  {{ end }}
```

:::tip
Variables may also point to some scope of the source and we can
traverse that scope when using the variable.

```yaml
{{ $currentHost := . }} # catches current scope
{{ range .paths }}
  # we can use {{ $currentHost.whatever }} here to break out of the .paths scope
{{ end }}
```
:::

#### Named Templates

We can create a `_helpers.tpl` (just a convention name) file to store various
snippets that we want to reuse (like some conditionals, loops, or just manifest
parts). The contents should be wrapped in the `define` function which allows us
to name the function.

:::tip
Global Names The names of named templates are global. It's a good practice to
prefix the name with chart's name. This way we can skip potential conflicts in
sub-charts.
:::

To use these named templates we need to `include` them in other templates. We
could also use Go's `template` instead to include it, but it is not as
functional (we can't pipe the output to another function).

:::tip[Libraries]
A chart of type "library" would contain functions only, without any templates.
:::

### Dependencies

Chart's dependencies can be included in the following ways:

- by placing chart's folders in `/charts` of the main chart
- by placing archives of charts in `/charts` of the main chart
- `dependencies` array in the `Chart.yaml` file.
- `dependencies` array in the `requirements.yaml` file - OBSOLETE! The
  `Chart.yaml` file is recommended nowadays.

The `helm dependency update {chart-name}` fetches latest versions of
dependencies matching ranges defined in the `Chart.yaml`. Helm downloads
dependencies as `tgz` archives and places them in the `/charts` directory.

:::tip[Chart.lock]
Similarly as in npm, Helm has the `Chart.lock` file, which lists the exact
versions of dependencies that have been pulled. Running `helm dependency build
{chart-name}` downloads dependencies as defined in that file.

Helm 2 used the `requirements.lock` file for the same purpose.
:::

#### Conditions

Dependencies can be installed conditionally, based on configuration values
(`values.yaml`). An example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: mongodb
    version: 7.8.x
    repository: https://some-repo.com
    condition: database.enabled # values.yaml
```

Another way is to tag dependencies with `tag` and set that tag to `true/false`
in the `values.yaml`. It's useful if multiple dependencies shoud be
enabled/disabled at once.

:::tip[Priority]
Condition overwrite tags
:::

## Repositories

There are repositories of charts. We can add them to Helm CLI for it to be able
to fetch charts. There is an official repository at
[https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com](https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com).

By default, Helm CLI does not have any repositories configured.

Repos can be added with `helm repo add repo-name repo-url`.

A repository is just an HTTP server containing the charts and the `index.yaml`
file describing charts.

:::tip[Chartmuseum]
There's an HTTP server implementation dedicated for hosting Helm chart
repositories - [Chartmuseum](https://chartmuseum.com/)
:::

### Publishing

Before publishing our charts, we need to package them into archives. It can be
done with the `helm package {chart-name}` command. It results in a `.tgz`
archive being created.

## Internals

Helm stores details of releases in the K8s cluster itself - as secrets. They are
stored in the same namespace as the application/release.

:::tip[Helm 2]
In Helm 2, there was also a server-side component running on the cluster - Tiller.
Helm CLI would communicate with Tiller.

In Helm 3, Tiller no longer exists. Helm CLI communicates with the K8s API only.
:::

### Three-Way Merge Patch
Helm applies upgrades/downgrades by looking at the following:

- last installed chart version
- chart version to be installed
- current state of the app

It's possible that the release has been modified outside of Helm control (e.g.,
manually via *kubectl* or some operator). Even in such situations, Helm is able
to persist these manual changes, as long as they don't conflict with the chart
to be installed. Before applying the change, it marges the target state with the
"external" modifications.

## Namespaces

By default, Helm installs resources into the "default" namespace. However, we
can specify another namespace while installing.

## Commands

### Install a Chart

`helm install {release-name} {chart-name}`

### Uninstall a Chart

To remove a release, together with Helm-managed secrets metadata, run `helm
uninstall {release-name}`.

### Get Manifest

We can have a look at the YAMLs of the deployed release with `helm get manifest
{release-name}`.
