# Cluster

Machines are split into two groups:

- Control Plane - the brain of the cluster
- Workload Plane

## Control Plane

It consists of:

- Kubernetes API Server - RESTful API used by users and other components to
  create objects
- Scheduler - decides which node runs which app
- Controllers - have different tasks. Most of them create objects from the
  objects users create (e.g., if I create a *deployment*, it will create *pods*)
  Some communicate with external systems (e.g. cloud provider API). Most object
  types have an associated controller (e.g. "Deployment Controller" manages
  "Deployment" objects).
- etcd - the K8s API Server stores objects here. It's a distributed data store.

## Workload Plane

It consists of:

- Kubelet - an agent that talks to K8s API Server and manages apps running on a
  node. It reports apps' status via the API
- Container Runtime - runs containers
- Kube Proxy - load-balances traffic between apps.
- apps

There are also some addons that could be on Worker or Master nodes.

## Failures

In case of a failure of a node, its status changes to **NotReady**. The pods
that were supposed on that node are still kept as **Running** for the next few
minutes. After that time, the pods will be recreated on other nodes.
The exact timings can be configured for the cluster.
