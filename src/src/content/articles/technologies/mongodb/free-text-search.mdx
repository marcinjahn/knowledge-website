# Free Text Search

A **Text Index** is required for free text search. Here's how to create one:

```js
db.cars.createIndex({name: "text"}) // just one idex on a "name" field
db.cars.createIndex({name: "text", colors: "text"}) // 2 indexes
```

Such an index can be created on fields that are of type "string" or on array of
strings.

Query example:

```js
db.cars.find({ $text: { $search: "Ford orange" }})
```

This query will look in the "cars" collection among created indexes for the
"Ford" and "orange" (separately) terms. If the index was created on multiple
fields, all of them will be searched.

##### Score

The returned results are scored. We can use that to decide which results are
more relevant than others.

```js
db.cars.find( {$text: { $search: "Ford" } }, {score: {$meta: "textScore"}})
```

Each document wil contain a "score" field. The higher the score, the more
relevant the result. We can sort the documents by score as well.
