# Server Name Indication (SNI)

Domain names are associated with IP addresses. Since IP addresses are limited in
their number, there's a need to host multiple websites (multiple domains) under
a single IP address.

## HTTP

With just HTTP (without TLS), we can solve this issue with the *Host* header
sent in the request. The server can read that header and serve the right
content.

## HTTPS

The issue comes when we switch to HTTPS. During the TLS handshake, the server is
supposed to send the client the certificate of the website. Since the *Host*
header I mentioned above is part of HTTP (layer 7 of OSI), there is no access to
it during the TLS handshake. SNI comes with an alternative solution.

### TLS

During the client-hello of TLS 1.3, SNI is sent - a domain name that we're
trying to reach. This way, the server can send server-hello with the right
certificate.

:::caution[Plain Text]
The SNI information (domain name) is unencrypted. The **Encrypted Client Hello
(ECH)** (previously ESNI) resolves that problem (TLS 1.3 only).
