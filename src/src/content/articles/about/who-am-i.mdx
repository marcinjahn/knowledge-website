# Who Am I?

<img src="/img/me.webp" style="float: right; margin-left: 40px; margin-top: 0; height: 120px"/>

My name is Marcin Jahn. I am a technology evangelist/developer/tech enthusiast
from Łódź, Poland. I am an automation and robotics engineer by education - but
frankly, I am not keen on working with robots, I much prefer software
development targeting the web/cloud. I am interested in all computer things, but
my main activities are in the following areas:

- cloud
- IoT
- containerization
- linux
- frontend development
- backend development

These are just some keywords that come to my mind at the moment. The world of
IT is so huge (end expanding all the time) that it's quite hard to encompass the
technology landscape that we're dealing with today with just a couple words.
However, looking at the list I think it summarizes quite well what I'm doing
most of the time in front of a computer.

## cirro.services

I provide software development services via
[cirro.services](https://www.cirro.services). If you need some help with your
project, consider contacting me [here](https://www.cirro.services/contact).

## Technologies

Here're a few technologies/products, called out by name, that I use and have
expertise in:

- **cloud**:
  - [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) - I have years of
    experience with Microsoft's cloud offerings. During my work I've been mostly
    dealing with App Services (Web Apps, Functions, Logic Apps), container
    offerings (Container Instances, AKS), databases and storage in general
    (CosmosDB, Storage Table, Storage Queue), IoT Hub, DPS, and many other
    services that I used together to build various systems. Regarding
    certification, I have the following certificates:
      - [Azure
        Fundamentals](https://www.credly.com/badges/b848fcd6-4168-4c47-bd47-0bd3048cb3fc)
      - [Azure Developer
        Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/4a6fd0b9-aad8-40cf-ba56-a0e741670c2a?source=linked_in_profile)
      - [Azure Solutions Architect
        Expert](https://www.credly.com/badges/7212a5f3-6fed-43b4-8957-b892d1129216)
- **IoT**:
  - [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/) - I
    started using it while working on my master thesis to build [my own IoT
    Platform](/projects/mjiot). I also use it extensively at work.
  - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) - this small PC is a perfect
    hardware for experimentation in various IT areas. I used it as an IoT device
    in some IoT projects.
- **containerization**:
  - [OCI containers](https://opencontainers.org/about/overview/) - using
    [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is
    nowadays a standard way to build and run applications, especially in the
    cloud. Most of the applications I build end up as container images.
  - [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) - an amazing initiative to standardize
    the way we deploy apps across cloud providers. Nowadays, I prefer deploying
    my apps there than using things like [Azure
    Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) or other
    SaaS solutions that were my preferred choice in the past. Regarding the
    actual cloud offering, I rely on [Azure Kubernetes
    Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/).
    Btw, [this website is hosted on K8s as well](./this-website)!
- **Linux**:
  - [Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/) - the operating
    system that I use on my Linux PC. It's just perfect for software development
    work. I think that working on a Linux-based OS makes it much more efficient
    to build applications that, in the end, will be running on Linux as well
    (probably in containers).
  - [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) - a great Linux distribution that is
    very transparent and easy to get into by developers. I plan to get back to
    it in the future. Currently, Fedora occupies my disk.
  - [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) - in my opinion, it's the most modern,
    pretty, and future-ready Linux DE that is out there at the moment. The second
    best is Pantheon of [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/).
- **frontend development**:
  - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - my favourite JavaScript framework. I find it
    the easiest to learn and use among the big three (Angular, React, Vue),
    which I all had experience with in the past.
  - [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) - an obvious choice of a static site
    generator for Vue.js enthusiasts. It's just easy to use and easy to extend.
    This website is built on VuePress as well.
- **backend development**:
  - [.NET C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) - the first programming
    language that I really got into and used professionally. Although nowadays I
    prefer a bit more "flexible" languages, like
    [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), I find .NET to be much more
    reliable, and it's my choice for bigger applications.
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - I've had a bit of a love-and-hate
    relationship with that technology. The flexibility of JS used to be a weird
    idea for me in the past. Later I started to appreciate that. I find Node.js
    to be a perfect tool for smaller applications or PoC/demo needs. It
    definitely can be used for bigger apps as well, but I just did not use it
    for such cases yet.
