## Skills

I am proficient in the following technologies:

#### Languages/Runtimes

- **.NET C#** - I've worked on various projects based on .NET, ranging from
  simple console apps and web APIs (ASP.NET Core), through microservices,
  running in the cloud (Azure Functions, Web Apps, Container Instnces, AKS), to
  desktop applications built with the WPF framework. I've started with .NET
  Framework, and switched to .NET Core as soon as it became mature enough.
- **NodeJS** - I've been using NodeJS for various applications, such as CLI apps or
  web APIs (Express and Fastify, also with NestJS on top)
- **TypeScript** - the best flavor of JavaScript; I use it for frontend
  or NodeJS apps that contain more than just a few functions.
- **Angular** - I've worked on SPAs built with Angular, also in projects
  utilizing NgRx.
- **Vue.JS** - I created numerous frontend apps using Vue.JS (I also have a lot of
  experience with VuePress, including creating custom plugins for it)

#### Other

  them Linux-first. I use Linux-based OS daily on my work machine.

  example of that.
