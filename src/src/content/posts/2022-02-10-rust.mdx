There seems to be a lot of hype around Rust recently. Especially in the Linux
community, Rust seems to be gaining popularity. One of the reasons for it is the
GTK 4 toolkit and the [gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/) bindings project
for it.

I wanted to explore why that language became so popular, so I decided to learn
it, at least on a beginner level. The lessons I've learnt have been noted in the
[Rust Series](/programming/rust/overview).

I think the language is quite interesting and its heavy focus on memory safety
has high impact on how the programmer writes code. You have to kind of switch
your mental model to what Rust requires and rememeber that variables should be
modified in one context only. There also seems to be a lot of ideas from
functional programming that Rust devs like to use, and Rust has some utilities
built-in to make it easier to apply them (like the `Result` monad). What I
really liked was the `match` keyword and the ease of returning data with it.
It's important to note though that Rust is quite a difficult language. There's
lots of things to keep in mind, especially when it comes to sharing data between
functions (even more difficult in parallel context). Personally, I still prefer
the ease of C# and freedon of JavaScript/TypeScript over Rust, but I can see why
many people seem to love it nowadays.

While learning Rust, I've purchased the [Rust in
Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action) from Manning. I got so
used to high quality of Manning publications and I did not expect any surprises
in that area. However, with that book, it seemed to me like the author was
delivering the content out of order, and it was just unbearable for me. I
stopped in the middle, and picked up the [official Rust
book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). I have to admit, it's one of the best
tutorial books I've ever read, and it cannot even be compared with the Manning
one.

The best way to learn any new programming language is to actually write some
code. I did just that and created a small CLI utility called
[Puff](/projects/puff). It is a fairly simple tool allowing you to manage
certain files (like configs) in a central place with the help of soft links.
You can view the code at [GitHub](https://github.com/marcinjahn/puff).

If you want to learn Rust, I suggest that you go through the [Rust
Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). [My content](/programming/rust/overview)
is a brief summary of that book.
