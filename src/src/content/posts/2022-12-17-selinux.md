# Overview of SELinux

I added an overview of the SELinux subsystem, which is one of the popular MAC
systems that are available on Linux. It's used mostly in the Red Hat world (Red
Hat Linux, Fedora), but can also be found on other Linux distributions (also on
Android). I was interested in the topic mostly due to the fact that Podman
relies on SELinux when mounting volumes. Lack of any SELinux knowledge might
lead to issues when containers try to access the mounted files. While learning
about SELinux, I found it to be quite an interesting topic. You can see my gist
of it [here](../technologies/linux/selinux.md).
