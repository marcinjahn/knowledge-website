# Nullability in C#

C# allows us to specify if a given variable/argument/... is nullable or not.
It works for both value and reference types.

However, in some cases that is not enough, and we can do more.
Here's an example:

```csharp
public string? GetFirstName(string? fullName)
{
  if (fullName is null)
  {
    return null;
  }

  // return non-null string...
}
```

The above method would be used as follows:

```csharp
var fullName = "John Smith";
var firstName = GetFirstName(fullName);

var length = firstName.Length; // Compiler generates a warning of possible null reference!
```

The `GetFirstName` method specifies that its output may be `null`.
It happens only when the input is null as well, but it's not communicated
in any way to the clients, causing a warning from the compiler,
even though the result will not be `null`.

For cases like that, .NET comes with a bunch of nullability attributes that
enrich nullability metadata of the method with more intricate details.
We could improve the method like this:

```csharp {1}
[return: NotNullIfNotNull(nameof(fullName))]
public string? GetFirstName(string? fullName)
{
  if (fullName is null)
  {
    return null;
  }

  // return non-null string...
}
```

We've added the
[NotNullIfNotNullAttribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.codeanalysis.notnullifnotnullattribute),
which will aid the compiler in delivering warnings only if the input to the
method is nullable. In the example shown before, the variable `fullName` was no
nullable. With the attribute in place, compiler will not generate the null
reference warning anymore.

Another case where theses attributes come useful is properties with getters and setters.
It could be that a setter accepts both null and non-null inputs, while the getter always 
returns a non-null value, because it has some default. It is illustrated below:

```csharp
[AllowNull]
public string SomeString
{
    get => _someString;
    set => _someString = value ?? "default";
}
private string _someString = "default";
```

The
[AllowNullAttribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.codeanalysis.allownullattribute)
has effect only on the setter. Citing
[MSDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/attributes/nullable-analysis#preconditions-allownull-and-disallownull):

> The AllowNull attribute specifies *pre-conditions*, and only applies to
> arguments. The get accessor has a return value, but no parameters. Therefore,
> the AllowNull attribute only applies to the set accessor.

:::tip[Generics] 
Attributes such as `MaybeNull` might be expecially useful in
the context of generic types, where nullability (`T?`) is a bit more complex
than in concrete types, due to value and reference types having different
implementations of nullability. More information can be found at
[MSDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references#generics).
