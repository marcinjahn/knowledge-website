# Source Generators

Source Generators is a feature that allows us to generate new code, based on
existing (written by us) code (and other files). The generation happens at compile time.

:::caution
Source Generator cannot edit existing code! It can only add new code (e.g., new
classes).
:::

Generation can happen not only based on source code, but also based on other
kinds of files, like `.txt` files for example. E.g., a txt file containing a
list of words could be there, and some enum could be generated based on that.

It's often needed to extend some existing class via source generation. In order
for a class to be extensible this way, it has to be `partial`. Since source
generator can only add new code, and cannot modify existing source, this is the
only way to extend existing classes.

:::tip
Source Generator could even generate code based on some database entries, or
some webservice response! Note that such generator could have a serious impact
on IDE experience!
:::

Source Generators run during compilation. When working on a project in an IDE,
projects could be often built, and sevice generators could be invoked often.
Performance could become an issue (of developer workflow only, since runtime will not
be hit by that!)

## Incremental Generators

Starting with .NET 6, source generator classes have to:

- implement the
  [IIncrementalGeneretor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.iincrementalgenerator)
  interface
- have the `[Generator]` attribute

Incremental Generator is a pipeline of operations that lead to new source code
generation. An important part of it is *memoization*. Stages of the pipeline
utilize caching. This is due to the feet that every code change triggers
compilation in IDE. To not kill performance, incremental generator will only run
these stages of the pipeline that will produce different results than before.

## Interesting Use Cases

### Performant Logging

The `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` package from Microsoft has a built-in support
for [source-generated
logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logger-message-generator).

### Faster Enum to String

Andrew Lock has created a
[NetEscapades.EnumGenerators](https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators)
package, that will auto-generate (among other things) `ToStringFast()` methods
for each enum marked with `[EnumExtensions]` attribute. It is much faster than
reflection-based `ToString()`.
