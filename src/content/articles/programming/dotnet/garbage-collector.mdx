# Garbage Collector

.NET uses Garbage Collection to free up memory from unused objects, that is
objects that are unreachable from the application root.

:::tip
Value types are not part of Garbage Collection cleanup process. They live on
the stack and they're naturally added and removed to/from it.
:::

There are 4 generations of GC:

- **Gen 0** - for ephemeral objects, like objects allocated in some method, that
  are no longer in scope after that method's execution is over. Gen 0
  deallocation is the cheapest, objects basically land on top of the heap, and
  are removed from there as soon as the method's execution is over.
- **Gen 1** - also for ephemeral objects. Objects that go untouched after at
  least one Gen 0 pass are Gen 1. This could be an object being assigned to some
  property of a class instance.
- **Gen 2** - for long-lived objects that have stayed alive after a few Gen 1
  passes. It could be a property of a static class, or some other objects that
  live through the whole lifetime of an app.
- **LOH** (Large Object Heap) - objects bigger than 85 kilobytes.

Moving up the generations, the cost of GC becomes higher (Gen 0 is the
cheapest). Therefore, whenever possible, it's good to keep our objects in the
Gen0/1 range, or, even better, use value types.

## GC Modes

Garbage Collection may work in different modes:

- Background Mode - enabled by default. Only Gen 2 is collected in the background.
- Workstation Mode - also enabled by default. Gen 0 and Gen 1 are collected in
  the foreground thread, pausing user code. It's blocking, but it's relatively
  cheap (since it's Gen 0/1)
- Server Mode - ideal for server-side apps. Each CPU core gets its own heap.
  Also, each core has its own GC thread running in the background. It's
  non-blocking, but uses more memory (30-40% more) and CPU. We can enable that via csproj. It
  can give you a huge boost of performance if utilized in scenarios where
  throughput is really important.

## Tips

### Pooling Objects

When dealing with lots of potentially expensive objects creations, it could be a
better idea to reuse pooled objects instead. That way, GC will have less work to
do, since there will be less objects to deallocate. Microsoft provides
[ObjectPool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/objectpool)
for this (and
[ArrayPool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.buffers.arraypool-1?view=net-7.0)
specifically for arrays).

Good candidates for pooling are:

- StringBuilder
- byte array

So, instead of creating an object every time, you crete a pool of them (like
hundred, or a thousand, depending on your needs), and request/return objects
from/to the pool during the lifetime of the app.

Object Pool is also useful if object creation is expensive, since you can create
a pool of reusable objects on startup and just use them afterwards.

### Empty Collections

Whenever an empty collection is needed, do not create a new object, use
`Array.Empty<T>` instead, which skips unnecessary allocation.

### Stackallock

We are able to allocate objects on the stack instead of the heap.

```csharp
var array = stackallow new byte[500]();
```

A few facts to keep in mind:

- can't be done in async methods
- shouldn't be used to allocate too much data, otherwise stack overflow will occur
- it will always be faster than allocating objects on the heap
