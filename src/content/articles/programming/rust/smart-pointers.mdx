# Smart Pointers

The most common kind of pointer in Rust is a **reference**. **Smart Pointers**
not only act like pointers but also have additional metadata and capabilities,
like reference counting. There are a few types of smart pointers in Rust.

References borrow data, while smart pointers often own the data.

:::tip
`String` and `Vec<T>` are smart pointers! They own some memory and can
manipulate it. They have metadata (like capacity).
:::

There are some built-in smart pointers and there are many in crates. We can
write our smart pointers as well.

## Traits

Smart pointers are usually structs. They implement `Deref` and `Drop` traits.

### Deref

`Deref` allows an instance of a struct to behave like a reference, so consuming
code can work either with references or smart pointers. It does it by allowing
customizing the behavior of the *dereference operator* (`*`).

Here's an example of how dereferencing may be used with smart pointers, same as
with [references](/programming/rust/ownership#dereferencing):

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;
  let y = Box::new(x);

  assert_eq!(5, x);
  assert_eq!(5, *y); // compiler calls *(y.deref()) behind the scenes
}
```

`Deref` trait has one method - `deref()` - it should return a `&`
(immutable) reference. By using `*`, the compiler calls `deref()` behind the
scenes to get a reference, and then it knows how to get value behind that
reference.

#### Deref Coercion

Rust can automatically dereference values to proper types if possible. For
example, if a function expects `&str` we can pass it `&String`. The compiler
will call `defer()` on the `&String` to get `&str`. The compiler can call `deref()`
as many times as needed until the proper type is found. E.g., if we had
`Box<String>` it would have to call `deref()` twice:

> `&Box<String>` -> `&String` -> `&str`

:::tip[DerefMut]
Similar to `Deref` is the `DerefMut` trait. It enables the resolution of mutable
references `mut&`.
:::

### Drop

`Drop` allows writing code that will be run when the type goes out of scope.
E.g. it could release some resources like files or connections. It is similar to
`IDisposable` interface in the .NET world. In the case of smart pointers, `Drop`
will deallocate the memory on the heap.

The `Drop` trait has one method - `drop()`. The compiler will call it automatically
when the value goes out of scope.

:::tip[Dropping manually]
If we need to destroy an instance before its end of the scope, we can call
`drop(instance)`. It's not the same `drop()` as the one implemented via the
`Drop` trait! Calling that one explicitly is not allowed.
:::

## Box

It's the most straightforward smart pointer. It allows storing data on the 
heap instead of the stack. Only the pointer stays on the stack.

### Storing Data on the Heap

```rust
let b = Box::new(5); // 5 is on the heap
println!("b = {}", b);
```

When `b` goes out of scope, both the `Box` and `i32` it points to get
deallocated.

### Recursive Types

Data on the stack needs to be of a known size. Not all values are. Recursive
types can infinitely contain other values of the same type - they are of unknown
size. They should be stored on the heap.

Example:

```rust
enum List {
  Cons(i32, List),
  Nil,
}

let list = Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)));
```

This enum does not compile; its size is unknown.

<Image src={inifiniteStructSize} alt=""/>

Here's a version with a `Box<T>`:

```rust
enum List {
  Cons(i32, Box<List>),
  Nil,
}

let list = Cons(1, Box::new(Cons(2, Box::new(Cons(3, Box::new(Nil))))));
```

Only the `i32` 1 and the first `Box<T>` are stored on the stack. The rest is on
the heap:

<Image src={structOfKnownSize} alt=""/>

## Rc

The `Rc<T>` smart pointer enables multiple ownership - owning a value by
multiple bindings. *Rc* stands for *reference counting*. `Rc<T>` keeps track of
the number of references to a value. If there are none, the value can be cleaned
up safely. `Rc<T>` is useful when multiple actors in our program will read the
data, but we don't know which one will be the last to do that. Otherwise, we
could use the "normal" ownership concepts. `Rc` allows to have multiple
**immutable references**. Mutable references would bring chaos.

:::danger[Multi-threading]
`Rc<T>` is only for single-threaded scenarios!
:::

:::tip[Graphs]
`Rc<T>` is useful in graph-like structures where nodes may be pointed at by
multiple other nodes.
:::

```rust
enum List {
  Cons(i32, Rc<List>),
  Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
  let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
  let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
  let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
}
```

<Image src={graphWithRc} alt=""/>

There are 3 references to `a`, all of them encapsulated within `Rc`.
The value will "live" as long as any `Rc` instance still points to it.

:::tip[Performance]
`clone()` on `Rc` is cheap. It just increments the reference count. It's cheaper to
clone `Rc` than to clone the actual value that `Rc` points to.
:::

:::tip[Check count]
We can check the current reference count of `Rc` with `Rc::strong_count(&a)`,
where `&a` is a reference to an actual instance of `Rc`.
:::

### Weak

`Rc` allows to create two types of smart pointers:

- `Rc::clone(&a)` - strong reference (`Rc<T>`)
- `Rc::downgrade(&a)` - weak reference (`Weak<T>`)

Weak references do not increment the `strong_count`, they increment
`weak_count`. The `weak_count` does not need to be 0 for the value being
referred to to be dropped.

Since the value behind `Weak<T>` is uncertain it needs to be retrieved using 
the `upgrade()` method that returns `Option<T>`.

:::tip[Reference Cycles]
`Weak` is useful for protection against reference cycles. If some node refers to
another via `Rc`, it's a strong connection. If the other node needs to have a
reference to the first one as well, it would use `Weak`. That way, the
`strong_count` stays at 1 and the nodes can be dropped when they go out of
scope.

`Weak` is useful in graphs as an alternative to `Rc`.
:::

## RefCel

Here are the borrowing rules in Rust:

- At any given time, you can have either (but not both of) one mutable reference
  or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.

With references and `Box<T>`, the borrowing rules are enforced at compile time.
With `RefCell<T>`, these invariants are enforced at runtime. With references, if
you break these rules, you'll get a compiler error. With `RefCell<T>,` if you
break these rules, your program will panic and exit.

:::tip[Why?]
The `RefCell<T>` type is useful when you're sure your code follows the borrowing
rules but the compiler is unable to understand and guarantee that.
:::

:::danger[Multi-threading]
`Rc<T>` is only for single-threaded scenarios!
:::

Because `RefCell<T>` allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, you can mutate
the value inside the `RefCell<T>` even when the `RefCell<T>` is immutable. This
is **interior mutability** pattern.

> **Interior mutability** is a design pattern in Rust that allows you to mutate
data even when there are immutable references to that data. Normally, it's
disallowed by borrowing rules.

Here's an example of practical usage of `RefCell`:

```rust
struct MockMessenger {
  sent_messages: RefCell<Vec<String>>,
}

impl MockMessenger {
  fn new() -> MockMessenger {
    MockMessenger {
      sent_messages: RefCell::new(vec![]),
    }
  }
}

impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
  fn send(&self, message: &str) {
    self.sent_messages.borrow_mut().push(String::from(message));
  }
}
```

The `send()` message has an immutable reference to `self`, because it makes
sense from the client perspective of that method. Normally, sending data should
not modify the state of the sender object. However, our implementation is some
mock that is supposed to keep every call to `send()` for verification later on.
`RefCell` comes into the picture. We can use it as a pointer to a `Vec` that
stores the invocations. We can get a mutable reference to that vector with
`borrow_mut()`.

:::tip
`RefCell` also allows one to get an immutable reference using `borrow()`.
:::

`RefCell` keeps track of how many mutable and immutable references were taken
out of it. `RefCell`, following the borrowing rules still allows multiple
immutable references or only one mutable reference at a time! Breaking these
rules results in a panic (at runtime).

:::tip
We can combine the capabilities of `Rc` and `RefCell` to be able to get
**multiple owners** of **mutable** data. An example is
[here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html#having-multiple-owners-of-mutable-data-by-combining-rct-and-refcellt).
