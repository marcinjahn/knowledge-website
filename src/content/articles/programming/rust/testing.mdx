# Testing

Rust has built-in capabilities to write tests.

:::tip
Library projects have test module added by default.
:::

:::tip[Documentation code]
Rust can also test code that is a part of our API documentation.
These tests are run as part of `cargo test`.
:::

## Test Functions

A function is a test function when `#[test]` attribute is applied to it.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
  #[test]
  fn it_works() {
    assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
  }
}
```

A function fails when it panics. Otherwise, it passes.
Each test is run in a new thread.

:::tip[Result alternative]
Test functions might also return `Result<T, E>` instead of panic!ing.
:::

:::tip[Private methods]
Rust allows to run tests on private methods
:::

### Macros and attributes

Some useful testing macros:

- `#[cfg(test)]` - placed on a module. Thanks to it, the test module is compiled
  only when `cargo test` is used. It saves time and space when building the
  code.
- `#[test]` - required for a function to be runnable with `cargo test`
- `assert!(should_be_true)`
- `assert_eq!(expected, actual)`
- `assert_ne!(something, not_something)`
- `#[should_panic]` - it accepts an optional string that the panic should
  be thrown with. This helps to verify that the expected panic was thrown
- `#[ignore]` - test will not run. We can still force `cargo` to run it using
  `cargo test -- --ignored`. It'll run only the ignored tests.

:::tip[Failure Message]
These macros optionally accept a failure message that will be displayed in case
of failure. The message will be parsed by the `foramt!` macro, so it can contain
variables. Such a message might inform what the test was actually testing in more
detail.
:::

## Controlling Tests

### cargo test parameters

- `--test-threads=n` - allows to specify how many threads run the tests. We could set
  it to `1` to disable multithreading.
- `--show-output` - by default `print!` does not show anything for passing
  tests. This setting changes that
- passing single test function name will run just that function

## Organization

### Unit Tests

Unit tests should be placed in the same file as the code they're testing. A
separate `testing` module (with `#[cfg(test)]`) should be created to include all
the tests.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests should be separate from the tested code. There should be a
`tests` directory next to `src`. Each file in that directory will become a separate
crate.

:::tip
We don't need to annotate integration tests with `#[cfg(test)]`. Cargo knows that
files in the `tests` directory are tests.
:::

These tests will be run with `cargo test`.

:::tip[Helper Functions]
Integration tests can use some helper functions defined in a separate file. Such
fuctions should be placed under `tests/{some_subdirectory}` directory. Then,
`cargo test` will not treat these files as tests and will not try to run them as
such.
