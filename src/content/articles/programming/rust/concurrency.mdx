# Concurrency

Just like with memory, Rust is quite good at finding out potential concurrency
problems during compilation.

## Multithreading

Rust implements *1:1* threads, so when we create a thread in Rust, an actual
thread is also created by the OS. There are crates that implement M:N
threading.

### Creating a New Thread

```rust
thread::spawn(|| {
  for i in 1..10 {
    println!("hi number {} from the spawned thread!", i);
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
  }
});
```

Threads run closures. If the `main()` function finishes before threads finish
execution, they will be terminated anyway.

### Awaiting Threads

A `JoinHandle` may be used to wait for a thread to finish its execution. Its is
returned by `thread::spawn()`.

```rust
fn main() {
  let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
    for i in 1..10 {
        println!("hi number {} from the spawned thread!", i);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
  });

  handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

The app will finish only when the thread is done.

### Environment Ownership

Sometimes we might want one thread to pass ownership of some value to another
thread. We can do that with the `move` keyword placed before the closure.

```rust
fn main() {
  let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

  let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
    println!("Here's a vector: {:?}", v);
  });

  handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

## Messaging

Threads can communicate via **channels** where a **transmitter** sends messages
and **receiver** receives them.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();  // create transmitter and receiver

thread::spawn(move || {
    let vals = vec![
        String::from("more"),
        String::from("messages"),
        String::from("for"),
        String::from("you"),
    ];

    for val in vals {
        tx.send(val).unwrap(); // send a message
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
    }
});

// receive messages (treats rx as an iterator)
for received in rx {
    println!("Got: {}", received);
}
```

:::tip[mpsc]
`mpsc` module stands for *Multiple Producers, Single Consumer*.
We could clone tx and have another transmitter connected to `rx`.

Multiple receivers are not allowed in this model.
:::

The `send()` method takes ownership of the value being sent and transfers
ownership to the receiving thread.    d

:::tip[Receiving]
The receiver can use the following way to receive messages:

- iterator (as shown) - blocking, receives all messages.
- `recv()` method - blocking, receives 1 message.
- `try_recv()` - non-blocking, receives 0 or 1 message.
:::

## Shared Memory

### Mutex

Data can be guarded by a mutex, which allows access to that data to only one 
thread at a time.

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
  let m = Mutex::new(5);

  {
    let mut num = m.lock().unwrap();
    *num = 6;
  }

  println!("m = {:?}", m);
}
```

To get access to data protected by a `Mutex`, we have to call `lock()` on it.
This is a blocking call, execution will continue as soon as either:

- lock is free
- another thread that had the lock panics

:::tip[Smart Pointer]
`lock()` returns a `MutexGuard` smart pointer.
:::

The lock is released as soon as `MutexGuard` goes out of scope.

:::tip[Interior Mutability]
`Mutex<T>` is a bit similar to `RefCell<T>`. Even though the `Mutex` instance is
defined as immutable, we can change the value inside of it.
:::

:::danger[Deadlock]
Threads using `Mutex` can suffer from deadlocks!
:::

### Arc

We can't use `Rc<T>` in multithreaded contexts. Instead, we can use `Arc<T>`, which
is thread-safe (and has some performance overhead due to that).
We can use `Arc` to share values between many threads. The example below shares a `Mutex`:

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
  let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
  let mut handles = vec![];

  for _ in 0..10 {
    let counter = Arc::clone(&counter); // like Rc, Arc can be cloned to copy ownership to the value
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
      let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();

      *num += 1; // we increment in one thread at a time thanks to Mutex
    });
    handles.push(handle);
  }

  for handle in handles {
    handle.join().unwrap();
  }

  // counter has value 10
}
```

## Traits

There are a few traits that are important for concurrency.

### Send

The `Send` marker trait indicates that ownership of values of the type
implementing `Send` can be transferred between threads. Most types implement it
with some exceptions (like `Rc`, which is not thread-safe). Any type that
contains only `Send`-marked fields is automatically marked as `Send` as well.

### Sync

The `Sync` marker trait indicates that it is safe for the type implementing
`Sync` to be referenced from multiple threads. Similar to `Send`, types composed
entirely of types that are `Sync` are also `Sync`.

:::caution
Manually implementing `Send` and `Sync` is unsafe.
