# Collections

## Arrays

Arrays are placed on the stack, since their size is static and
always needs to be predefined.

```rust
let countries = ["Poland", "Brazil"];
```

Iterator is returned with `countries.iter();`.

```rust
for country in countries.iter() {

}
```

Array is typed like this: `[u32, 5]` - 5 elements of type `u32`.
Each array with different type and size is like a separate type in Rust.

## Vectors

Another collection type. It's dynamic, so it's placed on the heap (it's a
struct). `Vec<T>` is like a `List<T>` in C#. They are more expensive than
arrays. Elements are placed next to each other in memory.

Creating vectors:

```rust
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new(); //empty
let v = vec![1, 2, 3]; // infers type, uses a macro
```

Operations on vectors:

```rust
let mut v = Vec::new(); // no type needed, it's infered from the code below

// update
v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);

// read
let third: &i32 = &v[2];

match v.get(2) {
  Some(third) => println!("The third element is {}", third),
  None => println!("There is no third element."),
} // returns Option<&T>
```

The second way of reading will not panic if we try to access element out of
index. It will return `Option.None` instead.

## HashMaps

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

let team_name = String::from("Blue");
let score = scores.get(&team_name); // returns Option<&T>
scores.entry(String::from("Yellow")).or_insert(60); // inserts only if Yellow key is not there yet
```

## Iterators

Iterators give access to consecutive elements in collections. Iterators
implement the `Iterator` trait, which exposes `next()` method and `Item`.
It's easy to define our own iterators.
Iterators provide _zero-cost abstractions_, they are very performant.

There are three methods on collections that return iterators:

- `iter()` - iterates over immutable references to items in the collection
- `iter_mut()` - iterates over mutable references to items in the collection
- `into_iter()` - returns owned values from the collection

### Consuming Adaptors

Some methods defined on the `Iterator` trait take ownership of the iterator
and return something useful. An example is the `sum()` method.

#### Collect Function

The `collect()` function consumes iterator into an actual collection
of values.

```rust
let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
```

It also has a specific implementation that can turn an `Iterator<Result<T>>` into a
`Result<Vec<T>>` (so it kind of reverses the outer layers).

`collect` is one of cases where we often need to provide the expected output type in cases where
various outputs are possible.

:::tip
When using the `?` operator, it is not a part of expected type. E.g.:

```rust
let table_names = table_cells
    .iter()
    .map(|table_cell| table_cell.get_table_name())
    .collect::<Result<Vec<String>>>()?;
```

I have to provide type information to collect, `?` alone is not enough to infer the type.
Also, I cannot just do:

```rust
let table_names: Vec<String> = table_cells
    .iter()
    .map(|table_cell| table_cell.get_table_name())
    .collect()?;
```

The compiler only looks at the result of `collect` and not `?`, so the specified type of
`<Vec<String>>` is wrong, because the compiler knows that `table_cell.get_table_name()` returns a
`Result<String>`.

### Iterator Adaptors

Some other methods can transform an iterator into another kind of iterator.
These iterators are lazy, so to actually do anything the resulting iterator
needs to be consumed.

Examples:

- `map()` - takes a [closure](/programming/rust/closures) to be executed agains
  each item and returns closure's result. It's similar to JS's `map` in concept.
- `filter()` - returns an iterator that filters source collection based on a
  closure returning bool.
- `skip()` - skips some items.

:::tip
`collect()` applied on top of iterator adaptor returns a new collection of
values.
