# Cargo

Cargo is a **build system** (turns Rust code into executable binaries) and a
**package manager** (downloads and compiles project's dependencies). It's
analogical to node's `npm`.

`cargo new` creates a new project from a standard template. There's a
`Cargo.toml` file and the `src/` directory.

:::tip[rustc]
We could use `rustc` directly to compile our programs, but that's just inconvenient.
`cargo` uses `rustc` behind the scenes, and automates various operations, like
fetching dependencies.
:::

## Toml file

The `Cargo.toml` file contains the project's metadata (like npm's
`project.json`). After building the project, `Cargo.lock` is created as well,
which works like `project-lock.json` of npm. It specifies the exact version
numbers of all the dependencies. This way, future builds are reliable. If we
want to update some crates, ignoring pinned versions from `Cargo.lock`, we can
run `cargo update`. It will update the versions (respecting SemVer), and it will
also update `Cargo.lock` with the new versions.

## Running

`cargo run` does the following:

- compiles the code in debug mode (for maximal error information) using `cargo
  build`
- executes the binary

:::tip
`cargo run --release` compiles a *release* build.
:::

The binaries are produced in `/target/debug/` or `target/release/`.

## Release Profiles

Rust apps have two profiles:

- **dev** (used with `cargo build`) - good defaults for development
- **release** (used with `cargo build --release`) - good defaults for release
  builds

These profiles can be customized in the `Cargo.toml` file. Example:

```toml
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0

[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
```

The `dev` profile has 0 optimizations (because we want it to compile fast even
though the code runs slower).

## Other commands

- `cargo build` - downloads dependencies and compiles the code into an
  executable binary. It uses the "rustc" compiler behind the scenes.
- `cargo check` - checks if the code compiles, without building the binary. It's
  faster than `cargo build`.
- `cargo doc` - builds HTML documentation for every dependency in the current
  project.
- `cargo init` - initiates a Rust project with pre-existing files in it. `cargo
  create` would create a project from scratch.
- `cargo add` - adds crates. This subcommand needs to be installed first with
  `cargo install cargo-edit`.

## Crates

Packages are called *crates*. The open-source ones are shared at
https://crates.io.

### Binary crates

Binary crates might be installed with `cargo install some-crate`. They will be
installed in the `$HOME/.cargo/bin` directory.
