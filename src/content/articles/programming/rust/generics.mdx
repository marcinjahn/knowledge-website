# Generics

Generics may be used in:

- structs
- functions
- enums
- methods

:::tip[Monomorphization]
Generics are not slower than non-generic code. Rust generates concrete types for
the generics during compilation. It looks at all the usages of generics in our
code and creates types for all the ways that we use them. It's called
**monomorphization**. E.g. `Option<i32>` becomes `Option_i32`.
:::

:::danger[Limitation of generics]
An instance of a generic type `T` with some trait bounds may only be used with
one type in place of `T`. For example, a `Vec<T: SomeTrait>` is not able to
store multiple different types that implement `SomeTrait`. All of the values it
stores need to be of the same type (any type that implements `SomeTrait`). To
have more polymorphic behavior and be able to store values of different types,
[Trait Objects](/programming/rust/traits#trait-objects) should be used.
:::

## Functions

Function example:

```rust
fn largest<T: PartialOrd + Copy>(list: &[T]) -> T {
  let mut largest = list[0];

  for &item in list {
    if item > largest {
      largest = item;
    }
  }
  largest
}
```

The function `largest` is generic over some type `T`.

:::tip[Traits]
The function `largest` works only with types `T` that implement the `PartialOrd`
[trait](/programming/rust/traits) (it provides comparing functionality (`>` operator)) and
the `Copy` trait (to support only the types stored on the stack?).
:::

We can call this function like this:

```rust
let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
let result = largest(&number_list);
```

## Structs

Struct example:

```rust
struct Point<T> {
  x: T,
  y: T,
}

fn main() {
  let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
  let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
}
```

## Enums

Enum example:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
  Some(T),
  None,
}
```

## Methods

Method example:

```rust
struct Point<T> {
  x: T,
  y: T,
}

// the T after impl means that we're defining this method generically
// and T is not any specific type
impl<T> Point<T> {
  fn x(&self) -> &T {
    &self.x
  }
}
```

We can also specify a method for a concrete type `T`:

```rust
impl Point<f32> {
  fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
    (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
  }
}
```

:::tip
In the code above, there is no type after `impl`, since this method is
not generic! Only `Point<f32>` instances will have this method.
:::

Or, we could specify a method only for `T`s that implement some traits:

```rust
impl<T: Display + PartialOrd> Point<T> {
  fn cmp_display(&self) {
    if self.x >= self.y {
      println!("The largest member is x = {}", self.x);
    } else P
    println!("The largest member is y = {}", self.y);
  }
}
```
