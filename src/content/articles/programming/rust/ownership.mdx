# Ownership

At one point in time, only one variable may _own_ a piece of data.
If a given variable holds data on a stack, the data is just copied:

```rust
let a = 4;
let b = a;
// there will be two "4" on the stack
```

In case of heap data, only the pointer is copied:

```rust
let a = String::from("abc");
let b = a;

// a is no longer a valid variable! b is the owner now!
```

Unique to Rust, the `a` variable becomes invalid when the code above gets
executed. If we try to access it, it will result in a panic. Thanks to it,
during runtime Rust will not try to `drop` (`free`) this memory space twice,
which would be wrong.
It is called a **move**. `a` gets _moved_ to `b`.

Passing a value to a function also causes a _move_!

```rust
fn main() {
  let s = String::from("abc");
  some_func(s);
  // s is no longer valid. The ownership was moved!
}

fn some_func(data: String) {
  // At the end, `data` goes out of scope and `drop` is called
}
```

A function may also move ownership by returning a value. Then, the calling
function's scope owns the variable.

## References

Sometimes we want to pass a value to a function, but also to continue to use it
in the calling function. We could make the called function return the passed-in
value, but that would be a weird workaround, especially if that function is
supposed to return some other data as well. **References** come to the rescue.

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1 = String::from("hello");

  // pass as a reference
  let len = calculate_length(&s1);

  println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
  // we can still use `s1`
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
  s.len()
  // s has no ownership. When it goes out of scope, nothing happens
}
```

Creating a reference is called **borrowing**.
References are *immutable* by default. We can change that:

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut s = String::from("hello");

  change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
  some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

Both the `s` variable and the `some_string` reference need to use the `mut`
keyword to allow mutations of the value.

:::danger
At any given time, you can have either:

- one **mutable** reference
- any number of **immutable** references. 

This will fail:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s; // Wrong!
println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
```

Also, if there is an immutable reference, another one that is mutable cannot be
created:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem
let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
```

That's because if one function would get an immutable reference, it will expect
that the value should not change suddenly.

:::tip
A referenceâ€™s scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the
last time that reference is used.
This is OK:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s; // It's OK!
println!("{}", r2);
```

`r1` gets created, but it is never used afterwards. `r2` may be created.

With Rust, it's impossible to have dangling pointers. Rust will complain of such
issues at compile time.

### Dereferencing

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = &y;

assert_eq!(5, x);
assert_eq!(5, y); // WRONG! i32 and &i32 are different types
```

Sometimes we might need to obtain an actual value that the reference is pointing
to. We can do that we the **dereferencing operator**:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = &x;

assert_eq!(5, *y); // OK
```

:::tip[Smart Pointers]
[Smart pointers](/programming/rust/smart-pointers) might be dereferenced as well.

## Slices

Slice is a part of some collection.
It is basically a pointer to some index of that collection and a count of
elements starting from that index.

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let slice = &a[1..3];
```

### String Slice

Sometimes we need to "extract" a part of a string. Instead of creating a totally
new string, disconnected from the original one, we can use a **String Slice**.

```rust
let s = String::from("abcd");

let slice = &s[1..3];
```

`slice` contains the pointer to the first character of the slice, and the length
of the slice. Additionally, the slice has a reference to `s` (?), so `s` cannot
be mutated while `slice` is still in use.

:::tip
All string literals are slices!

```rust
let s = "abc"; // It's a slice!
```
:::

A reference to a string is treated as a string slice.
