# Event Queues

Event Queues are provided natively by most popular OSs, and they
are also abstracted away by popular low-level libraries such as:

- libuv
- mio


## OS Differences

Linux (`epoll`) and macOS (`kqueue`) have readiness-based event queues.
Windows (`IOCP` (IO Completion Port)) uses completion-based queue.

**Readiness-based** queue is simpler - it notifies us of
readiness when the resource is ready to be consumed, but
it does not do anything with the data for us, we need to
read it by ourselves.

**Completon-based** queues notify us when the resoure is ready
and they also expose the data for us (like file contents) in a
buffer that we provide to the OS.

Operating Systems expose special calls that allow us
to create new event queues, add handles there, and calls 
to await for events to be ready/complete. The last one will
suspend the thread. When the event is ready, thread
will be woken up.

## Linux epoll

Focusing on `epoll` on Linux, the API of working with the event queues is as follows:

```rs
pub const EPOLL_CTL_ADD: i32 = 1;
pub const EPOLLIN: i32 = 0x1;
pub const EPOLLET: i32 = 1 << 31;

#[link(name = "c")]
extern "C" {
    pub fn epoll_create(size: i32) -> i32;
    pub fn close(fd: i32) -> i32;
    pub fn epoll_ctl(epfd: i32, op: i32, fd: i32, event: *mut Event) -> i32;
    pub fn epoll_wait(epfd: i32, events: *mut Event, maxevents: i32, timeout: i32) -> i32;
}

#[derive(Debug)]
#[repr(C, packed)]
pub struct Event {
    pub(crate) events: u32,
    // Token to identify event
    pub(crate) epoll_data: usize,
}

impl Event {
    pub fn token(&self) -> usize {
        self.epoll_data
    }
}
```

To work with `epoll`, we'd:

1. Create a new queue via `epoll_create` - it returns a file descriptor representing the queue
2. Call `epoll_ctl` to configure the queue:
    - provide file descriptor that we want to be notified about (e.g. a file, or TCP stream)
    - provide bitmask (`op`) with appropriate settings configured (e.g. we want READ events)
    - provide `epoll_data` that will help us to identify the event.
      The value we set here will be provided to us when the notification comes.
3. Call `epoll_wait` - it will block the thread until some notification comes in.

We could repeat step 2 multiple times for different events/file descriptors, and reuse the same
event queue instance to notify us about different events.
When we start all the async operations, and don't have anything more to do, but just waiting
for the data to come in, blocking the thread is really the only thing we will want to do (step 3).
