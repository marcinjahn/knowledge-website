# Routing in Angular

Angular has a built-in router. When initializing a new project, the CLI asks if
it should be included or not. If we opted for "No" initially, we can add routing
module manually:

```sh
ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app
```

We can also configure routing in the `AppModule` file:

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: MainPageComponent, pathMatch: 'full' }, // match only if path is literally ''
  { path: 'home', redirectTo: '/' } // reusing a route under a different URL
  { path: 'users', component: UsersComponent },
  { path: 'movies', component: MoviesComponent },
  { path: 'movies/:movieId', component: MovieComponent },
  { path: '404', component: NotFoundComponent },
  { path: '**', redirectTo: '/404' } // catch all undefined cases
];

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    // ...
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot(routes)
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

The selected component will be rendered as a child of `AppComponent`. We need to
specify the exact placement of that component:

```html
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

The routes array should generally contain a wildcard route that handles all bad
links. Usually, it would redirect the user to some 404 page.

:::danger[Order of Routes]
The order of the routes matters! We should always place the wildcard route at
the end, otherwise some meaningful route could be handled as 404.
:::

Paths of routes defined in the array are **prefix paths** by default. It means
that Angular will match it whenever the beginning of browser's URL matches the
route's path. If we want the route to be selected only when the whole URL is
matched (without the host though), we should add the `pathMatch: 'full'` option.

## External File

Usually, we do not define routes directly in `app.module.ts`. Instead, we'd
create a separate module file `app-routing.module.ts` with the routing setup
inside of it.

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: MainPageComponent, pathMatch: 'full' },
  // other routes...
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    RouterModule.forRoot(routes)
  ],
  exports: [ RouterModule ],
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
```

Then, the `app.module` file gets simplified:

```ts {9}
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    // ...
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    AppRoutingModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

We can also [split routes per feature](/programming/angular/modules#routes).

## Navigation in HTML

With routing in place, we don't want to navigate between different pages in our
app with traditional `<a href="/whatever">Whatever</a>`. Clicking such a link
will work and the user will be taken to the right component (if the `/whatever/`
route was configured), but it comes with a huge issue - the whole application
will actually be reloaded from the server again. The app's state will be lost,
and it will be slow. Instead of that, we want the Angular Router to handle the
navigation, making it an in-app navigation rather than a browser-based
navigation. Here's how `<a>` elements should look like:

```html
<a routerLink="/home">Home</a>
```

The link above is applied to the host of the page. If we didn't include the `/`,
the `home` segment would be applied to the currently open page. It works
differently in [Programmatic Navigation](#navigation-in-code)!

:::tip[Array]
We can also split our link into segments, and use it like this:

```html
<a [routerLink]="['/home', userId]">Home 3</a>
```

`userId` would be some component's property. The array syntax makes it easy to
construct the URL dynamically.
:::

### Styling

In order to have visual indication on the currently visited menu element, we
would normally attach some CSS class to that active element. Angular comes with
a helper directive that does that automatically - `routerLinkActive`.

```html
<div routerLinkActive="active">
    <a routerLink="/">Home</a>
</div>
```

The element that has the directive on it will have the "active" class attached
to it when the link is active. The directive can be attached on the `<a>` or on
some element that wraps it, like in the example above.

:::caution[Exact]
By default, the `routerLinkActive` directive applies the active class to
any link that is part of the current URL. For examle, a link to "/" would
always be marked as active, because it's always going to be a part of URL. In
order to fix that, we would have to specify additional configuration:

```html
<div 
    routerLinkActive="active"
    [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{ exact: true }">
    <a routerLink="/" >Home</a>
</div>
```

With that, the Home link will be marked as active only when the URL is exactly `{domain}/`.
:::

## Navigation in TypeScript

Router is accessible via TS as well.

```ts
export class SomeComponent {
  constructor(private router: Router) { }

  onButtonClick() {
    this.router.navigate(['/somewhere']);
  }
}
```

:::tip[Dependency Injection]
Router can be injected into classes, just like any other service.
:::

The path that we navigate to is (by default) relative to the root.
Having or not having slash in the beginning does not change anything (it does
matter with [routerLink](#navigation))! We can change the path that `navigate`
will be executed in relation to with `relativeTo`. For example, we could pass to
it the currently activated route (`ActivatedRoute`).

## Route Inputs

### Path Parameters

Route's path can have parameters. In the code example at the top of this page,
`movies/:movieId` is an example of that. `movieId` is a parameter, and the
`MovieComponent` will receive it.

#### ActivatedRoute

We can get information about currently loaded route by injecting
`ActivatedRoute`. It contains various metadata about the loaded path, e.g. the
parameters.

```ts {4,7}
export class MovieComponent implements OnInit {
  movieId: string;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.movieId = this.route.snapshot.params['movieId'];
  }
}
```

The parameters may also be subscribed to via an `Observable` -
`this.route.params`. It might be useful when we plan to link from some site to
itself with different parameters. In such a case, Angular will not reload the
whole component for optimization. Instead, only the `ActivatedRoute` will
change.

### Query Parameters

We can also make use of query parameters. To attach them to links on our page,
we do it as follows:

```html {3}
<a 
  [routerLink]="['/home', '3']"
  [queryParams]="{ darkMode: true }">
  Home 3
</a>
```

Here's how we add query params from TS:

```ts {3-5}
this.router.navigate(
  ['/somewhere'], 
  {
    queryParams: { darkMode: true }
  });
```

Here's how we can read query params from TS by injecting `ActivatedRoute`
(`route` variable):

```ts
const { darkMode } = this.route.snapshot.queryParams;
```

Similarly to path parameters, we can also subscribe to `this.route.queryParams`.

#### Preserving Query Params

When we're on some page with some query params in the URL, by default these
query params will be removed when we navigate to another page. If we don't want
that, we can do it the following way:

```ts
this.router.navigate(
  ['/somewhere'], 
  {
    queryParamsHandling: 'merge'
  });
```

The `merge` handling merges together existing query params and those that we
might want to add (by having `queryParams` defined).

### Fragment

Similarly, we can attach fragment (`#fragment`) to link we navigate to:

```html {3}
<a 
  [routerLink]="['/home', '3']"
  fragment="something">
  Home 3
</a>
```

Here's how we add fragment from TS:

```ts {3-5}
this.router.navigate(
  ['/somewhere'], 
  {
    fragment: 'something'
  });
```

Here's how we can read fragment from TS by injecting `ActivatedRoute` (`route`
variable):

```ts
const fragment = this.route.snapshot.fragment;
```

Similarly to path parameters, we can also subscribe to `this.route.fragment`.

### Static Data

Routes can have some static data defined. This way, the same route can be reused
multiple times. For example, we could have a generic `ErrorComponent` which
displays different message depending on the kind of error. Such a component
could look like this:

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-error',
  template: '<h2> {{ errorMessage }} </h2>'
})
export class ErrorComponent implements OnInit {
  errorMessage: string;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.errorMessage = this.route.snapshot.data['message'];
  }
}
```

We can set the static value(s) in the routes collection:

```ts {7-8}
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: MainPageComponent, pathMatch: 'full' },
  { path: 'home', redirectTo: '/' }
  { path: 'users', component: UsersComponent },
  { path: 'movies', component: MoviesComponent },
  { path: 'movies/:movieId', component: MovieComponent },
  { path: 'not-found', component: ErrorComponent, data: { message: 'Page not found' } },
  { path: 'not-ready', component: ErrorComponent, data: { message: 'This page is under construction' } },
  { path: '**', redirectTo: '/not-found' }
];
```

## Nested Routing

Nested Routing allows us to have multiple routing outlets, one within another.
We could have a main menu with each entry of it loading a different submenu.
Then, each submenu would have a list of links that load a different content.

First, we need to set up our routes properly:

```ts {7}
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: MainPageComponent },
  { path: 'users', component: UsersComponent },
  { 
    path: 'movies', 
    component: MoviesComponent, 
    children: [
      { 
        path: '/:movieId', 
        component: MovieComponent 
      }
    ] 
  }
]
```

In the example above, `/:movieId` is a nested route. The full path (without
host) to it is `/movies/:moviesId`.

The next thing to do is to place an outlet where the `MovieComponent` will be
rendered. We should place it somewhere within `MoviesComponent`:

```html
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

With this setup, when navigating to `/movies/<id>`, the following will happen:

- the `MoviesComponent` will be rendered in the `router-outlet` within the
  `AppComponent`
- the `MovieComponent` will be rendered in the `router-outlet` within the
  `MoviesComponent`

The setup could be more complex, having multiple children under the `movies`
path, or by having more levels of nesting.

## Guards

Routes can be protected by **Guards**. The user may be either allowed or
disallowed to enter some content. It could be due to them being (un)authorized
in some way.

Guards are services and we normally store them in `*.service.ts` files.

:::tip[Provide]
A guard, like any service, needs to be `provided` somewhere.
:::

Here's a simple example:

```ts
@Injectable() // for Router to be injected
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private router: Router)

  isAuthorized = true; // just for the sake of this example

  canActivate(
    route: ActivatedRoute, 
    state: RouterStateSnapshot)
     : bool {

      if (this.isAuthorized) {
        return true;
      } else {
        this.router.navigate('/unauthorized'); // take user somewhere
        return false; // not necessary since not returning anything also counts as negative result
      }
  }
}
```

The guard needs to implement `CanActivate`. Its `canActivate` method should
return one of:

- `bool | UrlTree`
- `Observable<bool | UrlTree>`
- `Promise<bool | UrlTree>`

:::tip
The actual logic of checking whether the user is authorized would probably be
put in some other service.
:::

:::caution
If we try to naviagate to the same page that we're currently in, guard for that
page will not be executed by default. This might be a problem when we want to
log the user out and navigate them to the same page, which normally should be
guarded.

The default behavior may be changed in the route configuration with
`runGuardsAndResolvers: 'always',`.
:::

### UrlTree

We can route users to some other page in the guard, most likely when the
condition is not satisfied. We use the `UrlTree` for that - it's one of the
types that may be returned from guards. Here's how we'd return it:

```ts
if (notAuthorized) {
  return this.router.createUrlTree(['/login']);
}
```

The `router` is an instance of a `Router`.

:::tip
It's OK to return either a boolean `true` or an `UrlTree` in the same guard
depending on the success/failure of the checked condition.
:::

---

The route should be enabled for selected endpoints in the routes definition:

```ts {6}
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: MainPageComponent },
  { 
    path: 'users', 
    component: UsersComponen,
    canActivate: [AuthGuard]
  },
  { 
    path: 'movies', 
    component: MoviesComponent, 
    children: [
      { 
        path: '/:movieId', 
        component: MovieComponent
      }
    ] 
  }
]
```

The `/users` endpoint is protected by our guard. If we applied the guard to the
`/movies` route, the child of it would also use it.

:::tip[Guarding Children]
If we just want to protect all the children of some route, and not the "parent"
route, our guard can implement `CanActivateChildren`. Then, we apply the guard
to the "parent" route, and the guard will be executed only on children.
:::

### CanDeactivate Guard

Similarly to checking if a user can enter some route, we can also check if they
should be able to leave it. This is to protect users from unintentionally
leaving half-done form, forgetting to save their work, etc.

Setting this up is a little bit more involved than using `CanActivate` guard.
That's because the guard will most likely need some input from the component
that we're leaving to know if the user should be able to leave. The component
could have some `isWorkSaved` variable, but the guard cannot reach it - it's a
separate class after all. We can solve this problem using generics.

Here's an example:

```ts
// the component protected by our guard should implement it
export interface DeactivatableComponent {

  // the logic to check whether the user can leave, e.g. isWorkSaved === true
  canDeactivate: () => Observable<bool> | Promise<bool> | bool;
}

// the guard
export class CanDeactivateGuard implements CanDeactivate<DeactivatableComponent> {  
  // ...
  
  // one of the params is our interface - DeactivatableComponent - it will be 
  // the protected component
  canDeactivate(
    component: DeactivatableComponent,
    currentRoute: ActivatedRoute,
    currentState: RouterStateSnapshot,
    nextState?: RouterStateSnapshot)
    : Observable<bool> | Promise<bool> | bool {

      // here's how we ask the component itself if user is allowed to leave.
      return component.canDeactivate();
  }
}
```

:::tip[DeactivatableComponent]
`DeactivatableComponent` is not part of Angular. It's a custom interface that
was needed to somehow connect the guard to the protected component (with the
help of generic class).

The interface could be extended to include some outputs from the `canDeactivate`
method. This way, the component could, for example, return some message
informing the user why they shouldn't leave. The guard would then display it
somehow (e.g. via `confirm()`).
:::

Next piece is the actual component's code. The component needs to
implement `DeactivatableComponent`:

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'my-component'
})
export class MyComponent implements DeactivatableComponent {
  isWorkSaved: bool = false;

  // ...

  canDeactivate() {
    return isWorkSaved;
  }
}
```

To use the new guard, we need to enable it in the routes collection:

```ts {6}
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: MainPageComponent },
  { 
    path: 'users', 
    component: UsersComponen,
    canDeactivate: [CanDeactivateGuard]
  },
  { 
    path: 'movies', 
    component: MoviesComponent, 
    children: [
      { 
        path: '/:movieId', 
        component: MovieComponent
      }
    ] 
  }
]
```

## Resolvers

When a given component needs some external data to be loaded before it can be
displayed, custom **Resolvers** can be used.

:::tip[Provide]
A resolver, like any service, needs to be `provided` somewhere.
:::

Here's an example of such a resolver:

```ts
interface Movie {
  // some info about a movie
}

@Injectable()
export class MovieResolver implements Resolve<Movie> {
  resolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot)
    : Observable<Movie> | Promise<Movie> | Movie {
      
      // Get the movie from some external service...
      // Probably the route's params/query params will be needed
      // to get the ID of the requested movie.
      return movie;
  }
}
```

To use the resolver, we attach it to the route that needs it:

```ts {9}
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: MainPageComponent, pathMatch: 'full' },
  { path: 'home', redirectTo: '/' }
  { path: 'users', component: UsersComponent },
  { path: 'movies', component: MoviesComponent },
  { 
    path: 'movies/:movieId', 
    component: MovieComponent, 
    resolve: { movie: MovieResolver }
  },
  { path: '404', component: NotFoundComponent },
  { path: '**', redirectTo: '/404' } 
];
```

Here's how we can access the result of resolver's work in the `MovieComponent`:

```ts
export class MovieComponent implements OnInit {
  movieDetails: Movie;
  
  ngOnInit() {
    this.route.data.subscribe(data: Data => {
      this.movieDetails = data['movie'];
    });
  }
}
```

We subscribe to the result, because the resulting data could change when we
reload the component (Angular will not reload the whole component for
performance reasons).

The result is placed in `this.route.data` object under the key that we used in
the route definition's `resolve` section (`movie` in this case). The `data`
object was also used in the [Static Data](#static-data).

## Lazy Loading

Lazy Loading is described in the
[Modules](/programming/angular/modules#lazy-loading) section.
