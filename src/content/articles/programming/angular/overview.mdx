# Angular Overview

Angular is an SPA framework, once very popular, nowadays rather losing interest
year by year. It has its legacy though, I think it did a pretty good job of
popularizing TypeScript. Interestingly, it uses TypeScript's
[Decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html)
feature, which is experiemntal since as long as I remember (and I started with
Angular 2, and we're at Angular 14 at the moment I'm writing this).

## Installation

Go to [https://angular.io/cli](https://angular.io/cli) and follow the
instructions.

## Basic Commands

-   `ng new my-app` - creates a new app (togethre with its directory)
-   `ng serve -o` - local development server, `-o` opens the browser automatically
    at `localhost:4200`
-   `ng generate component whatever` - or simly `ng g c whatever` - generates a
    new component.

    :::tip[Subfolders]
    `ng g c somefolder/somecomponent` will create `Somecomponent` in the
    `src/app/somefolder` directory.
    :::

## Modules

By default, the app has the `AppModule` module. We can also create more of them.
A module is like a package that bundles things together. With simple apps, the
default `AppModule` is enough. Each component needs to be registered in some
module (in the `declarations` array).

:::tip[ng generate]
`ng generate component` automatically adds the new component to the module's
`declarations`.

How does it know which module to add it to?
