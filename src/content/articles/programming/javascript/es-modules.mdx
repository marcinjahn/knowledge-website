# ES Modules

## IIFE

A way to make file's data non-global is to use IIFE:

```js
(function () {
    statements
})();
```

This way, if we add some JS file to HTML, we'll not be able to access that JS's
data from the HTML file (encapsulation).

Modules are better for that.

## ES6 Modules

Modules characterics:

- they are singletons - every file that imports the module gets the same thing.
  If something gets modified in exported module by some client, all other
  clients will see that
- one module is one file

### Exporting

There are a few ways to export a module:

#### Named Export

Contents of `myModule.js`

```js
export function functionOne() {...}
function functionTwo() {...}
export someValue = 4
```

OR

```js
function functionOne() {...}
function functionTwo() {...}
someValue = 4

export {functionOne, someValue}
```

Only `functionOne` and `someValue` get exported. The `functionTwo` is not
visible to the clients of this module.

To import it:

```js
import { functionOne } from './myModule.js'
```

We can skip `someValue` if we don't need it.

We can change the name of the exported entity:

```js
export {functionOne as myFunction, someValue}
```

Then we'd import it like this:

```js
import { myFunction } from './myModule.js'
```

#### Export Default

Contents of `myModule.js`

```js
export default function functionOne() {...}
function functionTwo() {...}
export someValue = 4
```

OR

```js
function functionOne() {...}
function functionTwo() {...}
someValue = 4

export {functionOne as default, someValue}
```

Only one thing can be exported as default. The client:

```js
import someFunc from 'myModule.js'
someFunc()
```

The client does not have to know the name of the thing he imports.

#### Aggregate Exports

One module can export another module, so that the consumer uses just one
"import".

```js
export {functionOne as default, someValue}
export {functionThree} from './anotherModule.js'
```

`functionThree` is not accessible to that aggreagate module, it just exports it
for the consumers of it (however, it could improt it and make use of it also).

### Importing

#### HTML

```html
<script src="app.js" type="module"></script>
```

#### Default Import

If module exports something as default, we can import it with any name:

```js
import something from 'myModule.js'
```

#### Named Import

```js
import { myFunction } from './myModule.js'
```

We can change name in the client:

```js
import { myFunction as func } from './myModule.js'
```

We can import all that was exported:

```js
import * as myModule from 'myModule.js'

myModule.functionOne();
```

#### Mixed Import

```js
import something, {someValue} from 'myModule.js'
```

OR

```js
import something, * as stuff from 'myModule.js'
```
