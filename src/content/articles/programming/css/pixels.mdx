# CSS Pixel

One of the units that we can use in CSS is a `px`. The name is confiusing,
because the CSS px does not represent the display pixel. Instead, it is a
[Reference Pixel](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#absolute-lengths). The
general rule is that **96 px (CSS px) = 1 inch**. This is physically true on
hi-dpi displays, and less true on low-dpi ones. W3C initially required all CSS
engines to render absolute sizes in a correct way, according to physical
dimensions. However, manhy implementations did not follow that and W3C
eventually dropped that requirement
([source](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/units.en.html)).

It is important, because it means that our current webpages that have sizes
defined in px will continue to work in the future as higher resolution screens
are developed.
