# Object-Oriented Programming in C

C is a procedural language, it does not support OOP principles, like
inheritance, or polymorphism. There are various approaches to kind of add OOP
into C. All of them are different variants of [type
punning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_punning).

All these approaches are inherently unsafe. Compiler will not catch all of the
issues, the program will just explode in the runtime (most likely "Segmentation
Fault").

## Using Union

This simples approach allows us to add some kind of polymorphism into C.

Here's a simple example:

```c
#include <string.h>

enum Type {
    PERSON,
    STUDENT,
    WORKER
};

struct Person {
    enum Type type;
    int age;
};

struct Student {
    enum Type type;
    int age;
    char faculty[20];
};

struct Worker {
    enum Type type;
    int age;
    char* job;
};

union Object {
    struct Person person;
    struct Student student;
    struct Worker worker;
};

int main() {
    union Object object;

    object.student.type = STUDENT;
    object.student.age = 20;
    strcpy(object.student.faculty, "Electrical Engineering");

    DoSomething(object);
}

void DoSomething(union Object object) {
    switch(object.person.type) {
        case PERSON:
            // do something...
            break;
        case STUDENT:
            // do something...
            break;
        case WORKER:
            // do something...
            break;    
    }
}
```

A few points to note:

- we have a base type (`Person`) and two "deriving" types: `Student` and `Worker`.
- the base type's members have to be repeated in every "inheriting" type (in the
  exact same order!). This is due to the fact that we're using a union, and the
  memory layout should be the same in every "derived" type. Any change in the
  base type requires changes in derived types (unsafe).
- we can recognize what the actual type is in the runtime via an enum.
- there's only one level of inheritance

:::tip[GTK]
[GTK](/programming/gtk/overview) Events use this exact approach! The base type
looks [as follows](https://api.gtkd.org/gdk.c.types.GdkEventAny.html):

```c
struct GdkEventAny {
    GdkEventType type;
    GdkWindow* window;
    byte sendEvent;
};
```

Every event has these members repeated, like we've seen in the simple example above.
The union type is [GdkEvent](https://docs.gtk.org/gdk3/union.Event.html).

## Using Parent Member

Let's look at a different approach that uses composition:

```c
#include <string.h>

enum Type {
    PERSON,
    UNIVERSITY_WORKER,
    PROFESSOR
};

struct Person {
    enum Type type;
    int age;
};

struct UniversityWorker {
    struct Person parent;
    char faculty[20];
};

struct Professor {
    struct UniversityWorker parent;
    unsigned int office_number;
};

int main() {
    struct Professor prof;
    prof.parent.parent.type = PROFESSOR;
    prof.parent.parent.age = 43;
    strcpy(prof.parent.faculty, "Electrical Engineering");
    prof.office_number = 52;

    struct Person* person = (struct Person*)&prof;

    DoSomething(person);
}

void DoSomething(struct Person* person) {
    switch(person->type) {
        case PERSON:
            // do something...
            break;
        case UNIVERSITY_WORKER:
            // do something...
            break;
        case PROFESSOR:
            // do something...
            break;    
    }
}
```

Notes:

- this time, we have an inheritance chain: `Base` -> `UniversityWorker` ->
  `Professor` (multiple levels of inheritance).
- we're using pointer casting to treat `Professor` as a `Person` (unsafe)

:::tip[GObject]
This approach is a basis of how [GObject](/programming/gtk/overview) is built.
The dirty bits are hidden behind macros that the apps built using GTK utilize.
