# Pointers

A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of some value.

The declaration looks as follows:

```c
float *my_pointer
```

The pointer is defined by the type of the value that it points to. This is
helpful, because:

- we can do various arithmetic operations on pointers (e.g. `++` will result in
  the correct amount of bytes being added).
- we can dereference pointers - the runtime needs to know how many bytes a given
  pointer points to and how to interpret them (e.g. `int` and `float` both take
  4 bytes, but the same contents mean different values)

The "star" sign may be placed adjacent to the type, or to the name, or both:

```c
int *pointer;
int* pointer2;
int*pointer3;
```

:::tip[Smart Pointers in C++]
C++ additionally has **Smart Pointers**, which are like pointers with added
reference counting. When the data pointed to by the pointer goes out of scope,
the value gets deleted automatically. Depending on who you ask you might hear that
this is a form of garbage collection.

Smart pointers might be *shared* or *unique* - the latter one is a bit similar
to the concept of [Ownership in Rust](/programming/rust/ownership) (it even
has a *move* operation!).
:::

## Use-cases

Pointers are useful for:

- passing data to functions by reference (e.g. `void increment(int *number)`)
- allocating memory on the heap and keeping reference to it

## Memory

Memory is organized as follows:


<Image src={memory} alt=""/>

Each slot is addressed.

A pointer stores an address to some value in memory:

<Image src={pointerInMemory} alt=""/>

The pointer itself also has an address in memory, it also is some variable.
In the case above, `&p` is `64`.

### Variables

When we define some variable, it will be assigned some address in memory. If we
try to print the value under that address, we will find some "random" data:

```c
int variable;
int *pointer = &variable;
printf("%d", *pointer); // 0 or some other trash value

```

## Usage

```c
int number = 10;
int *pointer;

pointer = &number; // address where value 10 is stored

// Dereferencing
int number_copy = *pointer; // returns the value stored under the address that the pointer contains

*pointer = 20; //updates the value of the `number` variable
```

### Arrays

An array can be treated as a pointer to **the first element** that it contains.

```c
int array[] = {1, 2, 3};

int *pointer = array; // same as &array[0]

printf("Address of array[0] = %x\n", pointer);
printf("Value of array[0] = %x\n", *pointer);

pointer++;

printf("Address of array[1] = %x\n", pointer);
printf("Value of array[1] = %x\n", *pointer);
```

Simply:

- address: `&array[i]` = `array + i` = `pointer + i`;
- value: `array[i]` = `*(array + i)` = `*(pointer + i)`

:::danger[Array and pointer are not the same thing]
An array variable cannot have its value set to some pointer!

```c
array = pointer; // wrong!
```

Therefore array variable is not the same as the pointer.
:::

#### Multi-dimensional Arrays

```c
int B[2][3];

int *p = B; // ERROR! B is a pointer to an array, not to an int
int (*p)[3] = B; // OK; 3 is needed because pointer arithmetics needs to "know"
                 // how many bytes to add in operations like p++
```

<Image src={multiDimensionalArrays} alt=""/>

Pointer arithmetic examples:

- Printing `B` (or `&B[0]`) would return `400` (the address of the first
  sub-array)
- Printing `*B` (or `B[0]` or `&B[0][0]`) would return `400` (the address of the
  first element in the first sub-array)
- Printing `B+1` (or `&B[1]`) would return `412` (the address of the second
  sub-array)
- Printing `*(B+1)` (or `B[1]` or `&B[1][0]`) would return `412` (the address of
  the first element in the second sub-array)
- Printing `*(*B+1)` (or `B[0][1]`) would return `3`.
- `p++` would move from `400` to `412`

:::tip
`B` is the address of the first sub-array.
`*B` is the address of the first element of the first sub-array.
`**B` is the value of the first sub-array.
:::

:::tip
In general, `array + i` moves us to the next element within the array. That way,
`B` being an array of arrays, `B + i` moves us to the next sub-array.
:::

#### Pointer to Pointer

```c
int x = 4;
int *p =  &a;
int **q = &p;
```

A `p` points to `x`. `q` points to `p`.

<Image src={pointerToPointer} alt=""/>

In this example, we have even `int ***` pointer (a pointer to pointer to pointer).

We can also dereference such "deep" pointers. For example:

```c
printf("%d", **q); // prints 6
```

:::tip[Arrays]
Pointers to pointers are analogical to multi-dimensional arrays. `int **pointer`
is analogical to `int array[][]`. `pointer` points to a pointer that points to
the first element of the inner array.

In general, replacing `*` with `[]` is a helpful mental technique in
understanding pointers.

`int (*p)[];` - it is analogical to `int **p;`
:::

#### Arrays as arguments

When a function accepts an array as an argument, a pointer to an array is
passed:

<Image src={arrayInArgument} alt=""/>

This means that `sizeof(A)` will be different in `main()` (20 bytes) and in
`SumOfElements()` (4 bytes - just the size of a pointer to an integer!).

:::tip
`Function(int[] A)` is treated the same as `Function(int *A)`. A typical C
`main` function has both `char *argv` and `int argc` as arguments - a pointer to
arguments and a count of arguments.
:::

:::tip[Multi-dimensional Arrays]
A function that accepts a multi-dimensional array has to specify the count of
elements in sub-arrays.

Examples:

```c
void func(int *a) // size of int is known

void func2(int *a[2]) // an array of arrays that contain 2 elements

void func3(int *a[3][2]) // an array where each item is 3 arrays of 2 items each
```
:::

### Returning a pointer

It's wrong to return a pointer to a variable on a stack:

```c
int *Add(int a, int b)
{
  int c = a + b;
  return &c;
}

int main()
{
  int a = 1;
  int b = 2;
  int *p = Add(a, b); // we got a pointer to a sum
  SomeOtherFunction(); // the value that p points to could be overwritten by the new stack frame!
}
```

Instead, we should allocate the result on the [heap](/programming/c/dynamic-memory/) and
return a pointer to it.

## Function Pointers

```c
int Add(int a, int b)
{
  return a + b;
}

int main()
{
  int (*p)(int, int) = Add; // pointer definition contains return type and a list of parameters
  int c  = p(2, 3); // executes Add via a pointer - adds 2 and 3
}
```

A pointer `p` points to a function `Add`.

:::tip[Ampersand and Start]
The address of a function can be retrieved just by the function's name (e.g. `Add`) or
with `&` (e.g. `&Add`).

We can invoke a function via a pointer just by using the pointer as if it was a
function (e.g. `p(2,3)`) or with a `*` (e.g. `(*p)(2, 3)`).
