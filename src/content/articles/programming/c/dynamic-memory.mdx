# Dynamic Memory

When a program needs to store huge amount of data in memory, or when the amount
of data is underterministic at compile time, the **heap** memory segment is
used. It is "unlimited" (unlike the **stack**).

## Heap commands in C

The following functions are used for heap management:

- `malloc` - allocates memory
- `calloc` - similar to `malloc`, but a bit more appropriate for arrays
- `realloc` - resizes allocated memory block; it can be used as a substitute of
  `malloc` or `free` with the right arguments passed in
- `free` - deallocates memory

:::tip[C++]
C++ additionally uses `new` (can be used instead  of `malloc`) and `delete` (can
be used instead of `free`) operators for heap management.
:::

### Storing data on the heap

#### Using C:

```c
// allocates a variable on a STACK
int a;

// allocates memory space on a HEAP (for int - 4 bytes) and returns a void pointer to it
int *p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
*p = 10; // storing data on the HEAP

// clear heap allocation
free(p); // the compiler stores somewhere info how many bytes were allocated

// array on the HEAP
int *p = (int*)malloc(20 * sizeof(int));
*p = 10; // first index (could be p[0] = 10;)
*(p + 1) = 20; // second index
```

In the example above the result of `malloc` is casted to `int*`, because
`malloc` returns a `void*` pointer.

:::tip[calloc]
`calloc` is a good alternative for `malloc` in the case of arrays.
It accepts two arguments:

- size of element
- number of elements

Additionally, `calloc` initializes the memory with zeros automatically.

`malloc(n * sizeof(int))` ~= `calloc(n, sizeof(int))`
:::

:::tip[Void pointer]
`void*` is a generic pointer type that needs to be casted to a proper pointer
type. It's there because `malloc`/`calloc`/`realloc` are "universal" methods
that can allocate memory for any type. Without `void*` we'd need separate sets
of these functions for all the different types. Additionally we'd need some way
to deal with custom types defined by the programmer.

:::caution[Not enough memory]
If memory cannot be allocated, `malloc` will return `NULL`.
:::

#### Using C++:

```cpp
// allocates a variable on a STACK
int a;

// a scalar on a HEAP
int *p = new int;
*p = 10;
delete p;

// an array on a HEAP
p = new int[20];
delete[] p;
```
