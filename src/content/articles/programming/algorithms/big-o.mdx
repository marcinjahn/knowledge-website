# Big O Notation

<Image src={bigOGraph} alt=""/>

We can use the Big O notation to describe Runtime Complexity (time) and Space
Complexity (memory).

## O(n^2)

It is a result of nested loops.

## O(log n)

It has good scalability. The remaining work items are reduced by half with
every iteration. An example of it is *binary search*.
