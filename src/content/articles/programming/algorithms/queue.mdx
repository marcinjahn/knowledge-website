# Queue

A queue may be implemented using:

- **array** - the array would have to be "circular" to keep up with
  enqueuing/dequeuing items. Without it, we'd have to increase array's size with
  enqueue operation taking the last index to infinity.
- **linked list** - simpler implementation, there is no issue resizing an array.
- **two stacks** - items are added to one stack. When dequeuing, the all items are
  moved to another stack, and then read from it.

:::tip[Stack]
Similarly, a stack may be implemented with two queues.

## Reversing

To reverse a queue, we can use a stack. First, we move all items from the queue
to a stack. Then, we move all the items from the stack to the queue.
