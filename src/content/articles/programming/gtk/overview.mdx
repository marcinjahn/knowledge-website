# GTK

GTK is a tookit for creating GUI apps, mostly targeting Linux systems and the
[Gnome Platform](https://www.gnome.org/). It uses the
[GObject](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/) (GLib Object System) base type system.

## Software Stack

Nowadays, the applications developed in GTK use the following tooling/services:

- [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) as a base for the app and widgets library
- [other GObject-based libs](https://gjs-docs.gnome.org) - lots of libraries,
  like Soup for HTTP
- [language bindings](https://www.gtk.org/docs/language-bindings/index)
- [Libadwaita](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libadwaita) as both the widgets
  library and design system
- [Gnome Builder](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder) as an IDE
- [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) for packaging the apps
- [Flathub](https://flathub.org/) for distribution of the apps

## Resources

Popularity of GTK apps development would certainly benefit from more materials
being available on the topic. These are the resources that I find the most
valuable:

- [Gnome Developer Portal](https://developer.gnome.org/) - a documentation and
  guides for developing for the Gnome Platform.
- [GJS Guide](https://gjs.guide/) - the Guide to [GJS](/programming/gtk/gjs/) with a bunch of
  information about GObject itself.
- [elementary Developer Docs](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/) - Elementary
  OS encourages the use of Vala and Granite widgets library, which might not be
  the most popular technologies out there, but the docs are a solid guide to
  building GTK apps, which will be useful for any developer starting out with
  GTK.
- [Gtk Inspector](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GTK/Inspector) -
  an app that allows for live inspection of GTK apps, similar to dev tools in
  web browsers.
- [GTK API Documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/) - API reference for GTK, GDK,
  Pango, and many other libs
- [GJS API](https://gjs-docs.gnome.org) - all the APIs exposed by GJS
- [Vala API](https://valadoc.org/index.htm) - same as above, but for
  [Vala](https://vala.dev/)
