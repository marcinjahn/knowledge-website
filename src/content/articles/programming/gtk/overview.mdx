# GTK

GTK is a tookit for creating GUI apps, mostly targeting Linux systems and the
[Gnome Platform](https://www.gnome.org/). It uses the
[GObject](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/) (GLib Object System) base type system.

## GLib and GObject

GObject is a library that is a base for many other Gnome libraries (like GTK).
It is a common base layer providing OOP paradigm to the C language. It may be
seen as an alternative to C++ or ObjectiveC, since it enables developers to
create classes, but in this case, directly in C (however, in a rather tedious
way, since it's still "just" C)!

GObject is a part of [GLib](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GLib) and uses the
same version numbers. GLib contains:

- GObject - type system
- GThread - threading
- GIO - I/O operations
- others...

:::tip[QT ]
A kind of similar thing to GLib in the KDE world is
[QtCore](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtcore-index.html).

Some features of GObject that are often used in GTK apps are:

- the `GObject` root base type
- signals (like events in .NET)

### Bindings

The GObject libraries are written in the C language. However, there are a bunch
of bindings for many other programming languages that open the toolkit to a vast
group of developers. Examples of supported languages include:

- C (obviously)
- [JavaScript](https://gjs.guide/)
- Python
- [Rust](https://gtk-rs.org/)
- [Vala](https://vala.dev/)
- [C#](https://github.com/gircore/gir.core)
- and more...

Since there is a lot of GObject-based libraries, there is an established way of
generating bindings for them - [GObject
Introspection](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The bindings, under the
hood, call the C libraries code via mechanisms similar to
[PInvoke](../dotnet/platform-invoke).

:::tip
GTK is a base for many other GUI frameworks, often those that taget multiple
operating systems (like [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/) or
[Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri)).
These frameworks often rely on GTK 3, since GTK 4 is still relatively new.

## Software Stack

Nowadays, the applications developed in GTK use the following tooling/services:

- [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) as a base for the app and widgets library
- [other GObject-based libs](https://gjs-docs.gnome.org) - lots of libraries,
  like Soup for HTTP
- [language bindings](https://www.gtk.org/docs/language-bindings/index)
- [Libadwaita](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libadwaita) as both the widgets
  library and design system
- [Gnome Builder](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder) as an IDE
- [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) for packaging the apps
- [Flathub](https://flathub.org/) for distribution of the apps

## Resources

Popularity of GTK apps development would certainly benefit from more materials
being available on the topic. These are the resources that I find the most
valuable:

- [Gnome Developer Portal](https://developer.gnome.org/) - a documentation and
  guides for developing for the Gnome Platform.
- [GJS Guide](https://gjs.guide/) - the Guide to [GJS](./gjs) with a bunch of
  information about GObject itself.
- [elementary Developer Docs](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/) - Elementary
  OS encourages the use of Vala and Granite widgets library, which might not be
  the most popular technologies out there, but the docs are a solid guide to
  building GTK apps, which will be useful for any developer starting out with
  GTK.
- [Gtk Inspector](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GTK/Inspector) -
  an app that allows for live inspection of GTK apps, similar to dev tools in
  web browsers.
- [GTK API Documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/) - API reference for GTK, GDK,
  Pango, and many other libs
- [GJS API](https://gjs-docs.gnome.org) - all the APIs exposed by GJS
- [Vala API](https://valadoc.org/index.htm) - same as above, but for
  [Vala](https://vala.dev/)
