# GObject

GObject is a library that is a base for many other Gnome libraries (like GTK).
It is a common base layer providing [OOP paradigm to the C
language](/programming/c/oop-in-c). It may be seen as an alternative to C++ or
Objective C, since it enables developers to create classes, but in this case,
directly in C (however, in a rather tedious way, since it's still "just" C)!

GObject is a part of [GLib](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GLib) and uses the
same version numbers. GLib contains:

- GObject - type system
- GThread - threading
- GIO - I/O operations
- others...

:::tip[QT]
A kind of similar thing to GLib in the KDE world is
[QtCore](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtcore-index.html), although QT is a C++
framework so it skips the entire "OOP in C" mess.
:::

Some features of GObject that are often used in GTK apps are:

- the `GObject` root base type
- signals (like events in .NET)

## History

GObject has been created in the 90s, and the design hasn't changed much since
then. It's been created before C++ has been standardized (and probably this is
why it was even created instead of just using C++).

GObject was originally a part of GIMP Toolkit, which was created for GIMP.
Later, GTK was extracted from GIMP to become a standalone thing.

## Implementation

The base type of all types in GTK is
[GTypeInstance](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/struct.TypeInstance.html) (also
GObject inherits from it). However, we usually use `GObject` as a base when we want to
refer to anything in the GTK world, since it implements the core things such as
signals or properties (it's a bit more complicated than that).

### Instances and Classes

GTK types have separate structs for instances and classes, e.g. there is
`GObject` (instance) and `GObjectClass`. The stuff in `GObjectClass` is shared
among all GObjects (a list of signals, properties, CSS classes, etc.), while
`GObject` contains instance-specific data.

Here's an example of types that we could find in GLib:

```c
struct GObject {
    struct GTypeInstance parent_instance;
};

struct GObjectClass {
    struct GTypeClass parent_instance;
};

struct GtkWidget {
    struct GtkObject parent_instance;
};

struct GtkWidgetClass {
    struct GtkObjectClass parent_instance;
};

struct GtkButton {
    struct GtkWidget parent_instance;
};

struct GtkButtonClass {
    struct GtkWidgetClass parent_instance;
};
```

The "Thing" and "ThingClass" structs are connected via `GTypeInstance` and
`GTypeClass`:

```c
struct GTypeClass {
  //....
};

struct GTypeInstance {
    struct GTypeClass* g_class;
};
```

So, for example, every instance of `GtkButton` will have a pointer to a (common)
instance of `GtkButtonClass`. There are even macros that allow us to retrieve a
ThingClass from Thing, like
[GTK_BUTTON_GET_CLASS](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/main/gtk/gtkbutton.h#L41),
(it's an equivalent of `((GTypeInstance*)instance)->g_type`).

There are lots of other macros, some of them just cast one type to another to
make the code more readable (plus, they can do some type checks for safety).

### Registration

Every type in the GObject inheritance tree (also our custom types) needs to be
registered. When registering we need to provide a bunch of information:
- what is the size of the instance
- what is the size of the [class](#instances-and-classes)
- what's the init function of the instance type
- what's the init function of the class type

:::tip
Well, actually we don't need to provide all this information, because there's a
[G_DEFINE_TYPE macro](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/func.DEFINE_TYPE.html) that
takes care of that, making it as simple as it can be, also verifying that we do
not register the same type multiple times, taking care of thread safety, and so
on.
:::

Thanks to the registration, the instantation of the new objects of the
registered type will be simplified later on, and it will properly set up the new
object using the GObject type system. Otherwise, we'd have to do a bunch of
things manually, probably making some mistakes in the process and also making
the code completely unreadable.

The registration process requires us to follow some conventions, like creating a
duet of instance and class types that we talked about before (and the class type
needs to have `Class` postfix!)

The registration returns a `GType`.

## Bindings

The GObject libraries are written in the C language. However, there are a bunch
of bindings for many other programming languages that open the toolkit to a vast
group of developers. Examples of supported languages include:

- C (obviously)
- [JavaScript](https://gjs.guide/)
- Python
- [Rust](https://gtk-rs.org/)
- [Vala](https://vala.dev/)
- [C#](https://github.com/gircore/gir.core)
- and more...

Since there are a lot of GObject-based libraries, there is an established way of
generating bindings for them - [GObject
Introspection](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The bindings, under the
hood, call the C libraries code via mechanisms similar to
[PInvoke](/programming/dotnet/platform-invoke/).

:::tip
GTK is a base for many other GUI frameworks, often those that target multiple
operating systems (like [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/) or
[Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri)).
These frameworks often rely on GTK 3, since GTK 4 is still relatively new.
