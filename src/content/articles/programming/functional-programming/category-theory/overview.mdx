# Category Theory

The point of Category Theory is to unify mathematical theories (like algebra,
geometry, set theory, etc.) into terms that could be common among all the
mathematics. It can also be seen as a higher level of abstraction above
other mathematical constructs.

Category Theory can be brought down to:

- Composition
- Identity

A **Category** is a bunch of **objects**. It's not a **set** of objects though,
since a set is already quite a loaded term, with its own palette of rules. For
simplicity, it's then just easier to say that a category is a bunch of objects.

An **object** is a primitive - it has no properties nor structure. It's like an
atom, or a point, the lowest level of abstraction that we can go down to.

There might be **morphisms** between objects. Here's an example of a morphism
*f* between objects *a* and *b*:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  a((a)) -- f --> b((b))
```

A morphism is an arrow that has a beginning and an end. Between object *a* and
object *b*, there can be:

- -1 morphisms
- 0 morphism
- many morphisms

An arrow can point from *a* to *b* and from *b* to *a* at the same time. Or,
there could be arrow(s) starting and ending at the same object.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  a((a)) -- f --> b((b))
  a -- g --> b
  b -- h --> a
  b -- i --> a
  b -- j --> a
  a -- k --> a
  b -- l --> b
```

:::tip[Objects]
The only reason why objects exist is to be able to mark the beginnings and
the ends of morphisms' arrows.
:::

So, a Category is a bunch of objects with morphisms between pairs of these
objects. A category could be seen as a kind of graph, loosely speaking - there
could be an inifinite number of arrows.

## Axioms

Composition and Identity are the fundamental rules of a category.

### Composition

If there's a morphism taking us from *a* to *b* and a morphism taking us from
*b* to *c*, then there has to be a morphism taking us from *a* to *c* defined
as: `g ○ f`. The `○` symbol mens that `g` is applied after `f` (`g ○ f` = `g`
after `f`).

:::tip
The `g ○ f` syntax might appear counterintutive, but it actually comes from the 
way how functions are applied in maths:

`g ○ f` = `g(f(x))`
:::

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  a((a)) -- f --> b((b)) -- g --> c((c))
  a -- "g ○ f" --> c
```

The `g ○ f` arrow is a **composition** of arrows `f` and `g`.
It's sometimes called **multiplication**.

:::tip
There can also be other arrows going from `a` to `c`.
:::

:::tip
The whole category can be defined by a table of all compositions (not
morphisms?) within that category.
:::

### Identity

Every object in a category has its *identity morphism*:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  a((a)) -- id_a --> a

  b((a)) -- id_b --> b
```

#### Composition with Identity

Composition of any morphism with identity returns the original morphism:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  a((a)) -- f --> b((b))
  b -- id_b --> b
```

```
id_b ○ f = f
```

That's the *right identity*.

We can also reverse the order of the morphisms:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  a((a)) -- id_b --> a

  a -- g --> b((b))
```

```
g ○ id_b = g
```

That's the *left identity*.

:::tip
Identity is then like a `0` in multiplication: `a * 1 = a`.
:::

### Associativity

```mermaid
flowchart LR

  a -- "h ○ (g ○ f)" --> d

  a -- "g ○ f" --> c

  a((a)) -- f --> b((b)) -- g --> c((c)) -- h --> d((d))

  b -- "h ○ g" --> d

  a -- "(h ○ g) ○ f" --> d
```

```
h ○ (g ○ f) = (h ○ g) ○ f

# Just like in multiplication:
a(bc) = (ab)c
```

## Example

An example of applying category theory could be the following. Let's imagine
that we have sets A and B:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  a0 --> b2
  a1 --> b1
  a2 --> b3

  subgraph A
    a0
    a1
    a2
  end

  subgraph B
    b0
    b1
    b2
  end
```

There is a mapping between A and B, so there exists a function that transforms
elements from A to elements from B.

Category theory is supposed to unify various mathematical terms or theories
under one umbrella. Therefore, we can transform the sets into category
representation:

```mermaid
flowchart LR

a((A)) -- f --> b((B))
a((A)) -- g --> b((B))
a((A)) -- h --> b((B))

a -- id_a --> a
b -- id_b --> b
```

A set becomes an object. We have objects *A* and *B*. Between them, three
morphisms have been drawn, because the sets A and B had three functions between
them.

We can also see that there is an identity defined for each object. In sets, such
identity would be a function that takes a set, and returns the same set.

If there was another set - C - and there was a function defined between some
element of B and C, we could draw another object - C - with a morphism between B
and C. Possibly, we could also have a composition consisting of morphisms
between A and B, and B and C.

After creating the set category, we can forget about the origin of that data,
i.e. that it was a bunch of sets. Now we work on that category using category
theory. It's an abstraction making it possible to look at a set (a "low-level
thing") from a higher level of abstraction. It's kinda like moving from
assembler to some high-level language. Instead of a set consisting of some
elements, we have a table of morphisms that define our new category. They define
the interface of this category. The sets themselves have been "shrunk" down to
points A and B.

:::tip[Programming]
In programming, we have types and functions. Types can be seen as sets, and
functions can be seen as functions mapping one set to another.
:::

## Functions

In set theory, functions are defined as relations. Relation is a set of tuples
*(a,b)*, where *a ∈ A* and *b ∈ B*. We have sets:

- *domain*
- *codomain* (which is a superset of a *range*)

A function takes elements from a *domain* and **maps** it to some element from a
*codomain*.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  a0 --> b2
  a1 --> b1
  a2 --> b3

  subgraph A
    a0
    a1
    a2
  end

  subgraph B
    b0
    b1
    b2
  end
```

:::tip
A relation is a subset of `A x B`. The domain is the set of elements in `A` and
the codomain is the set of elements in `B`.
:::

### Isomorphism

A function may be invertible. A function `y = f(x)` is invertible when there is
a way to transform it into `x = g(y)`. Such a function `f` has to be
*one-to-one* (which is a synonym of *injection*) and *onto* (which is a synonym
of *surjection*).

- **one-to-one**- there are no two arguments that have the same result. 
- **surjective** - the range and the codomain are the same

In other words, `g` is a reverse of `f`, if `g ○ f = id` (and `f ○ g = id`). A
function that is invertible is called an **isomorphism**. Here is an example of
an isomorphic mapping (it's the same illustration as up above):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  a0 --> b2
  a1 --> b1
  a2 --> b3

  subgraph A
    a0
    a1
    a2
  end

  subgraph B
    b0
    b1
    b2
  end
```

This is not an isomorphic function:

```mermaid
flowchart lr
  a0 --> b2
  a1 --> b1
  a2 --> b2

  subgraph a
    a0
    a1
    a2
  end

  subgraph b
    b0
    b1
    b2
  end
```

Given `b1`, we cannot resolve it to a single element from `A` since both `a1`
and `a2` map to `b2`.

---

Getting back to Category Theory, ismorphism cannot be defined in terms of
injective or surjective functions, because these terms have different names in
that context.

*Injection* (one-to-one) becomes **epimorphism** (epic).

*Surjection* (onto) becomes **monomorphism** (monic).

:::caution
In Category Theory, if a given morphism is both an epimorphism and monomorphism,
it doesn't necessarily constitute an isomorphism! It may be a fact for some categories (like a Set),
but it is not true in general.
