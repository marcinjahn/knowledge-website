# Other Magmas

[Monoid](./monoids) is just one of subsets of Magmas. There are others, like a semigroup.

## Semigroups

Semigroups is a superset of [monoids](./monoid). Every monoid is a semigroup,
while the opposite is not true. They have very similar requirements as monoids,
with an exception for the identity element - it does not have to exist for a
semigroup to be formed.

With that, a semigroup is a tuple consisting of:

- a set
- a binary operation

All the other Monoid rules still apply:

- associativity
- arguments of the operation must be of the same type as the returned value

### Examples

#### Minimum

An example of a semigroup is a set of real numbers, and the MIN operation.
Since there is no identity element (real numbers go from -Inf to +Inf), we cannot
call that semigroup a monoid.

:::caution[Computers]
In maths, the above statement about real numbers holds true. However, programming
environments do have limits on their number implementations, so we could
actually find an identity element. For the MIN operation, the identity element
would be the maximum numerical value possible to define in a given programming
environment. `MIN(MAX_VALUE, x)` would return `x` for any `x`.
:::

Similarly, MAX operation could form a semigroup, but not a monoid.

---

Other examples of semigroups, that are not monoids, include:

- T First(T first, T second)
- Last

### Accumulation

Just like monoids, semigroups may be accumulated. Having multiple values 
from some set, we can accumulate them into one element, with the use of
semigroup's binary operation.

```csharp
var values = new[] { 1 , 2 , 3 };
var first = values.First();
var result = values
    .Skip(1)
    .Aggregate(
        first, 
        (m, n) => Math.Min(m, n)
    );
```

Since semigroups do not have an identity element, in the example above we have
to make sure that the collection is not empty. Otherwise, what would a
`Math.Min` return? In case of monoids, where identity/neutral element exists,
that element would be returned from an accumulation.

## Quasigroups

Another subset of Magmas is Quasigroups. A quasigroup is a set Q with a binary
operation * that satisfies the *Latin square property*. Quasigroups don't
require an identity element to be there, or an operation to be associative.

:::tip 
Identity element and associativity are not required, which does not mean
that they are forbidden. This is why some monoids, some semigroups, but also
some magmas that are neither monoids or semigroups can be quasigroups.
:::

An example of a quasigroup that is neither a monoid or a semigroup is a set of
integers and the subtraction operation. Subtraction satisfies Latin square
property.

:::tip[Latin Square Property and Subtraction]
Let's consider the set of integers, denoted by "Z", and the binary operation of
subtraction, denoted by "-". For any two integers `a` and `b`, we need to find
unique integers `x` and `y` such that:

`a - x = b` => `x = a - b`

`y - a = b` => `y = b + a`

These solutions are unique because, for each specific pair of integers `a` and
`b`, there is only one possible value for `x` and `y` that satisfy the
equations. Since subtraction is a well-defined operation on the set of integers,
and we can always find unique `x` and `y` that satisfy the Latin square property,
subtraction does indeed satisfy the Latin square property in the context of
integer arithmetic.
:::

Quasigroups are not that useful in the programming area.

## Magmas

We've gone from monoids to quasigroups, and all of them are subset of a greater
set of Magmas.

Magmas is simply a set with a binary operation - no other requirements there!

### Examples

#### Rock Paper Scissors

The Rock, Paper, Scissors game may be thought of as a Magma.
If you think about it, the game may be modeled with a binary function:

```ts
type RPS = RockOrPaperOrScissors;

function play(choice1: RPS, choice2: RPS): RPS {
    if (choice1 === RPS.Stone && choice2 === RPS.Paper) {
        return choice2;
    }
    // and so on...
}
```

The function above (operation) does not have an identity element (not a Monoid),
and it is not associative (not a Semigroup), and it does not satisfy the Latin
Square Property (not a Quasigroup). However, it is a binary operation, so it
certainly is a Magma.

Interestingly, the Rock Paper Scissors "operation" is commutative (a*b = b*a),
but in the world of magmas that doesn't have any impact. Associativity would at
least give us a Semigroups, commutativity does not.
