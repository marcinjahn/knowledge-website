# Semigroups

Semigroups is a superset of [monoids](./monoid). Every monoid is a semigroup,
while the opposite is not true. They have very similar requirements as monoids,
with an exception for the identity element - it does not have to exist for a
semigroup to be formed.

With that, a semigroup is a tuple consisting of:

- a set
- a binary operation

All the other Monoid rules still apply:

- associativity
- arguments of the operation must be of the same type as the returned value

## Example

An example of a semigroup is a set of real numbers, and the MIN operation.
Since there is no identity element (real numbers go from -Inf to +Inf), we cannot
call that semigroup a monoid.

:::caution[Computers]
In maths, the above statement about real numbers holds true. However, programming
environments do have limits on their number implementations, so we could
actually find an identity element. For the MIN operation, the identity element
would be the maximum numerical value possible to define in a given programming
environment. MIN(MAX_VALUE, x) would return x for any x.

Similarly, MAX operation could form a semigroup, but not a monoid.
