# Monoids

A monoid is a combination of a set and an operation abd ab identity element. In
programming, a set is a data type (like a `DateTime`). A **monoid** is a subset
of a *semigroup*, it is more strict than the latter. A monoid has the following
requirements:

- operation must be *binary* - it acts on two inputs (e.g. addition, or a
  function `(Car, Car) => Car`). Notice that the type of inputs and the output
  is the same. That's because a Monoid is a combinaton of a single data type and
  an operation.
- it must be *associative* - e.g., `(1 + 2) + 3 = 1 + (2 + 3)` - order of
  evaluation does not matter, the result is the same.

  :::caution[Commutativity]
  Monoid does not have to be
  [Commmutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property)!
  :::

- there's a *neutral element*, sometimes also called the *identity element* -
  it's a value that is neutral in a sense that it does not incur any change, it
  does nothing when an operation is applied to it. An example of an identity
  element in the addition operation is `0`, because `a + 0 = a`. For
  multiplication, the identity element is `1`, since `a * 1 = a`.

A monoid could also be described as a triplet consisiting of:

- a set
- a binary operation
- an identity element

The above triplet must satisfy the aforementioned rules.

## Examples

- Addition on numbers, 0 is the identity
- Multiplication on numbers, 1 is the identity
- AND on boolean numbers, 1 is the identity
- OR on boolean numbers, 0 is the identity
- Concatenation on a collection, empty collection is the identity

### Tuples

Note that a tuple (also triple, quadriple, and so on...) may also be a monoid.
It will be one only if all of its elements are monoids. The same goes for types,
like a C# record. A C# record is a monoid if and only if all of its properties
form a monoid when combined with some operation and identity element.

Example:

```csharp
record RobotGroup(int PainerRobots, int SingingRobots, string[] DischargedRobots);
```

In the example abovr, `PainterRobots` and `SingingRobots` are integers. They
form monoids with addition and 0 as an identity element. In case of
`DischargedRobots`, the concatenation operation and an empty list form a monoid.

We may define the following operation on `RobotGroup`:

```csharp
public static RobotGroup Combine(this RobotGroup robotGroup, RobotGroup anotherRobotGroup) =>
  new RobotGroup(
    robotGroup.PainerRobots + anotherRobotGroup.PainterRobots,
    robotGroup.SingingRobots + anotherRobotGroup.SingingRobots,
    robotGroup.DischargedRobots.Concat(anotherRobotGroup.DischargedRobots)
  );
```

And here's the identity:

```csharp
public static RobotGroup Identity => new RobotGroup(0, 0, Array.Empty<string>());
```

##### Functions

Any function that returns a monoid is itself a monoid. The input parameters
do not matter.

An example could be the following TypeScript signature:

```ts
(string) => number
```

`number` forms a monoid under addition, and 0 identity element.
`string`, as a collection, also does form a monoid, however, it doesn't have to
for the function to form a monoid.

Here's some functions that follow the signature:

```ts
function countCharacters(text: string): number {
  return text.length;
}

function countDigitsInText(text: string): number {
  const digitMatches = input.match(/\d/g);
  return digitMatches ? digitMatches.length : 0;
}
```

Here's the identity element

```ts
const identity = (_: string) => 0;
```

The operation to form a monoid:

```ts
function combine(f1: (string) => number, f2: (string) => number): (string) => number {
  return x => f1(x) + f2(x); 
}
```

## Endomorphims

So far, we've been discussing functions that accept two arguments - binary
functions. Endomorphisms are simpler - these are unary functions that return the
same type as they accept as an argument. Here's an example:

```csharp
int Increment(int value) => value +1;
```

A quote from [Mark Seemann's
article](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/11/13/endomorphism-monoid/):

> You can compose two such unary operations together in order to get a composed
> operation. You simply take the output of the first method and use it as the
> input argument for the second method. That composition is a monoid. 

More precisely, the composition forms a function that forms a monoid, since
there will be an identity element (function), and associativity requirement will
be fulfilled.

## Accumulation

Having a collection of values that are part of some monoid's set, we can
accumulate them into one value. Such an operation is called *Reduce* or *Fold*
in functional programming.

```csharp
public static Thing Accumulate(IEnumerable<Thing> things)
{
  var accumulator = Thing.Identity;  // monoid's identity
  foreach (var thing in things)
  {
    accumulator = Thing.Operation(accumulator, thing);  // monoid's operation
  }

  return accumulator;
}
```

.NET has a built-in implementation of accumulation - `Aggregate`:

```csharp
public static Thing Accumulate(IEnumerable<Thing> things)
{
  return things.Aggregate(
    Thing.Identity,
    (accumulator, thing) => Thing.Operation(accumulator, thing)
  );
}
```
