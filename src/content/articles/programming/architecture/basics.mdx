# What is architecture?

Since Software Development as a profession borrows quite a bit of nomenclature
from the house building industry, the **architect** role could not be omitted.
Software architecture is usually understood as one of the following:

- the process of designing a software system
- the set of principles that we follow while building applications of some
  system
- a diagram of a system presenting what it's comprised of and how the inner
  parts are connected with each other

Every piece of software follows some architecture, sometimes it's more
explicitly defined, sometimes it's an "accidental" architecture, which had not
been planned, but rather comes out during the process of coding. The latter is
alright for smallest projects.

An architecture is there to:

- plan the solution well and avoid costly mistakes
- have an overall look at the system - allows to create diagrams, like C4.

## Architect Persona

The role of the software architect is usually seen as fundamental role in
building a system. Before any line of code gets written, there should be a
design prepared that will guide the developers to build a good system (unless
we're building something tiny).

A good architect should:

- have a decent understanding of the *problem space* - that way the proposed
  solution will trully apply to the problem that we want to solve

### Types of Architects

We often see the following titles being mentioned regarding software architects:

- Enterprise Architect - responsible for the design of rules to be followed by
  an enterprise as a whole
- Solution Architect - responsible for a selected product/solution. They know
  the problem that they got to solve and they come up with some solution to
  that, taking into account the constraints and resources at hand.
- Application Architect - designs a single application, what technologies to
  use, etc.

The decisions of an Enterprise Architect will have an impact on the other
architect roles. The policits and decisions made on the level of the
organization will have to be respected by any project within that organization.


## C4

C4 is a system of visualizing systems' architecture. There are 4 levels of
solution visualization in C4, from highest to lowest:

- Systems (C1) - a top-level look at a solution as a whole, where our system is a
  single block that users and our systems interact with
- Containers (C2) - each block is a single app, or some kind of data store, messaging bus, etc.
- Components (C3) - inner systems within an app, like controllers, and services
- Code (C4) - a collection of classes - it will change pretty often in an
  actively developed system, so it might be skipped sometimes.

It's important to note that System diagram shows sysem**s**, Container diagram
shows container**s**, and Component diagram shows component**s**. A Container
diagram does not show a content of one container (app), but rahter apps and
their interactions within the system.
