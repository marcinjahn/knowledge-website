# Database Tips

## Pagingation in SQL

Avoid using `OFFSET` when implementing pagination in SQL databases.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 1000
```

Such a query will make the database retrieve 1010 index entries(assuming there's an index on id)
and then discard the first 1000. This is not efficient.
Instead, the request should contain the last seen ID, which then can be utilized in a more efficient
query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id > 374839
LIMIT 10
```

The DB will get just 10 values from the index, since it knows how to find ID 374839 without going
through all the entries before it.
