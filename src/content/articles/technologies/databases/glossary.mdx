## Row ID

Row ID is a system-level identifier of individual rows in a table. It might be
the same as primary key of the table, but it doesn't have to be that (e.g,
Postgres has a separate _tuple_id_).

## Page

Page is a fixed number of bytes on the disk. A single page might fit many rows.
The amount depends from the size of the rows. When a DB engine reads a row, it
really reads the whole page (or multiple pages), so a page is the smallest unit
of I/O operations.

When reading a single column from a database, in reality, we have to read entire
rows (unless we're talking about column-store databases, such as Cassandra).

## Heap

Heap is a collection of pages. A table of a database is contained in a heap.

## Index

Index speeds up our queries, its role is very similar to an index in a book. More on indexes in
[Index](./db-index).
