## Row ID

Row ID is a system-level identifier of individual rows in a table. It might be
the same as primary key of the table, but it doesn't have to be that (e.g,
Postgres has a separate _tuple_id_).

## Page

Page is a fixed number of bytes on the disk. A single page might fit many rows.
The amount depends from the size of the rows. When a DB engine reads a row, it
really reads the whole page (or multiple pages), so a page is the smallest unit
of I/O operations.

When reading a single column from a database, in reality, we have to read entire
rows (unless we're talking about column-store databases, such as Cassandra).

## Heap

Heap is a collection of pages. A table of a database is contained in a heap.

## Index

Index speeds up our queries, its role is very similar to an index in a book. More on indexes in
[Index](./db-index).

## Database Engine

Database Engine is a core component of a database system that handles:

- on-disk storage
- CRUD operations

Database systems use database engines and add additional features on top, like server, APIs,
replication, partitioning, stored proceduresm and all the other user-facing features.

Some DBMS allow to switch between different database engines, or even use different engine in
different tables (e.g., MySQL, MariaDB, Mongo). Other systems have one fixed engine (e.g., Postgres).

SQLite can be considered as a database engine.

## Cursors

(Server-side) cursors are like iterators in the database world. Instead of getting all the data at once (which
might not be even possible if there's huge amount of data), we can go through the rows
systematically one by one. We can ask for some rows, process them somehow, and then ask for some
more rows, until we reach some goal. It saves memory, and improves the time of getting the first
bits of data.

Cursors work in transactions. Otherwise, the table contents would possibly change during our
retrieval, rendering unpredictable results.

Cursors require some state on the server, so creating lots of them can impact the DB performance.
