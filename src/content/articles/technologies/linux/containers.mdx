# Containers

## Namespaces

Containers rely on namespaces in Linux. There are 8 kinds of namespaces:

- cgroups
- mount
- process ID
- network
- IPC
- UNIX time-sharing system (UTS) - hostname, domain name
- users, groups
- time

Each container is assigned with new namespaces of these types, creating an
illusion for the process that it runs on a separate machine.

Diferent processes may also share some namespace types, but not others:

### Networking

Here's how network namespacing works. When a new container is started, it
receives a set of interfaces that are placed in new namespace:

### cgroups

cgroups are another feature of Linux kernel. It allows to limit system resources
assigned to a process (CPU time, CPU cores, RAM, disk, network bandwidth).

When we're setting restrictions for containers (e.g. `--memory="100m"`),
container engine actualy uses cgroups to limit the process.

## Capabilities

Containers should not be able to invoke sys-calls that may break other
containers (like changing time, or loading kernel modules).

Docker has `--privileged` flag that gives special permissions to containers.
It's not ideal, because it gives ALL permissions.

Another option is to use Linux **capabilities**. There are many of them giivng
granular access to specific operations.

Another option is **seccomp** (Secure Computing Mode). A custom profile (JSON
file) can be applied to a containers listing sys-calls that it can make.

Further hardening may be achieved with AppArmor or SELinux (MAC).

## Rootless Containers

Podman popularized the idea of using rootless containers. Previously, it was
common to run containers with Docker with root privileges, which translated to
root access on the host as well (although Docker does support rootless
containers as well!).

Rootless containers make use of user namespaces. It gives us access to user
mapping and allows us to run the container with any UID, even UID = 0, while on
the host system that UID would be mapped to a "normal", non-root user.

An easy way to test that is to run `podman unshare id`. It's going to run `id`
program in a user namespace. It will print "0" as a result. A non-root user on a
host (typically 1000) translates to a root in the namespace.
We can see the mapping offsets in the `/etc/subuid` file:

```
mnj:100000:65536
```

The output means, that the user 1 in a container will be mapped to user 100000
on a host. User 2 would be mapped to 100001, and so on. A maximum of 65536 users
may be mapped (that value may be modified, it's not a hard limit).

:::tip[unshare]
The `podman unshare` command is great help in translating host UIDs to container
UIDs. If, for example, some container runs with UID 1002, and we want to to give
that UID access to some files on the host, we could run `podman unshare chown
1002:1002 some-file`.

### Volumes and SELinux

Mounting volumes in rootles context is different than it is with rootful
environments. In the latter case, whatever you mount, it will probably just work
without any further tinkering. In rootless podman, you will often experience
issues with [SELinux](/technologies/linux/selinux/) (if your system uses SELinux MAC). One of
the ways to get around that is to apply the `:z` or `:Z` (private, additionally
uses MCS) to volume definition. That will apply the right SELinux labeling to
the files being shared as a volume (only if we're attaching host dir, it is not
needed when creating a volume entity).

Containers run with the `container_t` SELinux domain. They are allowed to access
the `container_file_t` and `container_ro_file_t` typed files. The `:z`/`:Z`
parameters apply the `container_file_t` to the mounted files.

:::danger
It's important to note that `:z` and `:Z` relabel the resource, which could
impact some other processes that require the original labels to be there! After
finishing the work with containers, it's probably a good idea to reset the
labeling with `restorecon`.
:::

Another issue could be due to traditional DAC permissions. The user mapping also
works for volumes, so a UID 0 in a container will map to UID 1000 on a host. So,
a container will be able to access files of UID 1000 on the host.

:::tip[Disable Labeling]
Labeling is a security feature that keeps processes within containers from doing
harm to files on the host. When the container is trusted though, we can relax
the security by disabling SELinux label separation for containers. 

We can do that for a single container while runing it with `podamn run` by
adding `--security-opt label=disable`.

It's also possible to disable SELinux for all podman containers via
`/etc/containers/containers.conf`.

## Standarization

Docker was the first container platform to make them popular. There's **CRI**
(Container Runtime Interface) that container platforms adhere to.
