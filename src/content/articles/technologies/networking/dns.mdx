# DNS

Here's a diagram of how DNS works:

<Image src={dns} alt="How DNS works"/>

We assume that there is some internal DNS server that we're reaching out to
first. It could be a DNS server hosted on our gateway.

The image presents the worst-case scenario, assuming that nothing was cached.

1. If the entry is in the DNS cache of the internal DNS server, and the TTL of
that entry has not expired, then the response is supplied immediately to the
client. Similarly, if the client is requesting an entry that's hosted on the
server in a zone file, the answer is supplied immediately to the client.
2. If the entry is not in the cache of the internal DNS server, or if it is in
the cache but the TTL of that entry has expired, then the internal server
forwards the request to its upstream providers (often called forwarders) to
refresh the entry. If the query is in the cache of the forwarder, it will simply
return the answer. If this server has the authoritative name server for the
domain, it will simply query that host (skipping ahead in the process to Step
5).
3. If the forwarder does not have the request in the cache, it will in turn
request upstream. In this case, though, it will likely query the root name
servers. The goal in this is to find the "authoritative name server" that has
the actual entries (in a zone file) for that domain. In this case, the query is
made to the root name servers for ".com".
4. The root name server will not return the actual answer, but will instead
return the authoritative name server for the top-level domain (TLD)â€”in this
case, for .com.
5. After the forwarder gets this response, it updates its cache with that name
server entry, then makes the actual query against that server.
6. The authoritative server for ".com" returns the authoritative DNS server for
"example.com".
7. The forwarder server then makes a request against this final authoritative
name server. 8. The authoritative name server for example.com returns the actual
query "answer" to the forwarder server.
9. The forwarder name server caches that answer, then sends a reply back to your
internal name server.
10. Your internal DNS server also caches that answer, then forwards it back to
the client. The client caches the request in its local cache, then passes the
requested information (the DNS response) to the application that requested it
(like a web browser)

## Layers

Logically, there are various layers of DNS:

1. Local/Internal DNS
2. External DNS (like `8.8.8.8`)
3. Root Servers (`.`)
4. TLD Servers (e.g., `.com`)
5. Other Authoritative Servers

There are 13 Root Servers (in reality these are rather clusters than servers).

## New Approaches

DNS requests are made without encryption. That basically means that ISPs can
track the websited that you visit. There are two approaches to circumvent that:
DoH and DoT.

### DoH

DNS over HTTPS - it basically turns DNS servers into HTTP(S) servers listening
on 443 for DNS queries.

### DoT

DNS over TLS. It's the standard DNS, but encrypted with TLS.
