My name is Marcin Jahn. I am a technology evangelist/developer/tech enthusiast
from Łódź, Poland. I am an automation and robotics engineer by education - but
frankly, I am not keen on working with robots, I much prefer software
development targeting the web/cloud. I am interested in all computer things, but
my main activities are in the following areas:

- cloud
- IoT
- containerization
- linux
- frontend development
- backend development

These are just some keywords that come to my mind at the moment. The world of
IT is so huge (end expanding all the time) that it's quite hard to encompass the
technology landscape that we're dealing with today with just a couple words.
However, looking at the list I think it summarizes quite well what I'm doing
most of the time in front of a computer.

## Technologies

Here arere a few technologies/products, called out by name, that I use and have
expertise in:

- **cloud**:
  - [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) - I have multiple years of
    experience with Microsoft's cloud offerings. During my work I've been mostly
    dealing with App Services (Web Apps, Functions, Logic Apps), container
    offerings (Container Instances, AKS), databases and storage in general
    (CosmosDB, Storage Table, Storage Queue), IoT Hub, DPS, and many other
    services that I used together to build various systems. I have the following
    Azure certificates:
    - [Azure
      Fundamentals](https://www.credly.com/badges/b848fcd6-4168-4c47-bd47-0bd3048cb3fc)
    - [Azure Developer
      Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/4a6fd0b9-aad8-40cf-ba56-a0e741670c2a?source=linked_in_profile)
    - [Azure Solutions Architect
      Expert](https://www.credly.com/badges/7212a5f3-6fed-43b4-8957-b892d1129216)
  - [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) - I have the [Professonal Cloud Architect certificate](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-architect).
- **backend development**:
  - [.NET C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) - the first programming
    language that I really got into and used professionally. It's still my
    preferred choice for new projects, and I really like the direction Microsoft
    is heading with the language.
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - I find Node.js to be a perfect tool for
    web APIs, smaller applications or PoC/demo needs. Paired with
    [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), it's a perfect environment for a project.
- **databases**:
  - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - I've used MongoDB in numerous projects,
    where performance and scalability were key. At this point, MongoDB is a mature
    and feature-rich database that is a great fit for lots of usecases.
  - [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) - I have experience in building
    search systems that rely on huge data sets, based on elasticsearch.
  - [CosmosDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/) - versatility of CosmosDB
    makes it a great choice for pretty much any project that requires a database.
    I mostly sticked with the MongoDB API and Table API for the projects I've worked on.
  - [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) - for one of the projects I worked on, it was necessary
    to collect timeseries measurements on cloud system's performance. InfluxDB turned out to
    be a great fit for that use case.
- **ci/cd**:
  - [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) - I've created quite a few CI/CD pipelines
    that run on GitHub Actions. Btw, [this website is deployed using GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marcinjahn/technology-notebook/tree/main/.github/workflows) as well!
  - [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/pipelines) - I've used Azure
    Pipelines in numerous projects, especially when the project was hosted on Azure.
- **containerization**:
  - [OCI containers](https://opencontainers.org/about/overview/) - using
    [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is
    nowadays a standard way to run applications, in the cloud or on the edge.
    Most of the applications I build end up as container images.
  - [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) - an amazing initiative to standardize
    the way we deploy apps across cloud providers. Nowadays, I prefer deploying
    my apps there than using things like [Azure
    Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) or other
    SaaS solutions that were my preferred choice in the past. Regarding the
    actual cloud offering, I rely on [Azure Kubernetes
    Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/).
    Btw, [this website is hosted on K8s as well](/about/this-website)
- **frontend development**:
  - [Angular](https://angular.io/) - I've worked on a few projects that
    incorporated Angular to build the client-facing experiences. These projects
    also relied on TypeScript, RxJS, NgRx, Jest, Angular Material, and others.
  - [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) - a great choice of a static site
    generator for Vue.js enthusiasts. It's just easy to use and easy to extend.
  - [Astro](https://astro.build) - another great static site generator. It puts
    a great accent on load speed of the sites built with it. This website used
    Astro!
- **iot**:
  - [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/) - I
    started using it while working on my master thesis to build [my own IoT
    Platform](/projects/mjiot). I also used it extensively at work.
  - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) - this small PC is a perfect
    hardware for experimentation in various IT areas. I used it as an IoT device
    in some IoT projects.
  - [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - I built numerous smaller projects on Arduino,
    mostly for experimenation before moving the project onto target hardware (mostly ATMega
    microcontrollers)
