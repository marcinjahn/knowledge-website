I've added a new set of articles on asynchronous programming to my website.
These articles are a deep dive into the mechanics of async operations, tailored
for those curious about how it all works beneath the high-level abstractions
provided by programming languages and frameworks. Here's a quick summary of
what's covered:

- [Overview of Asynchronous Code Execution](/programming/core/async/overview): An introduction to the basic concepts
and the difference between concurrency and parallelism. This article lays the
groundwork for understanding how async code operates, especially in the context
of operating systems and multitasking.
- [Event Queues](/programming/core/async/event-queues): A look into how operating systems like Linux, macOS, and Windows
handle async operations through event queues, and the implications for
programming.
- [Green Threads/Fibers](/programming/core/async/fibers): An exploration of green threads or fibers, which are
user-space managed threads that offer an efficient way to handle concurrency
without relying heavily on the operating system's thread management.
- [Stackless Coroutines and Async/Await](/core/async/stackless-coroutines): A detailed look at how modern programming
languages implement async/await patterns using stackless coroutines, simplifying
asynchronous programming.

These articles are my attempt to break down the complex topic of async
programming into more digestible parts. Whether you're a seasoned developer or
new to the concept, I hope you find these pieces enlightening.
