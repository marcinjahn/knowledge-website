I've been studying Angular for a few weeks now. Although I've used this
technology numerous times in the past (e.g., in [my master
thesis](https://github.com/marcinjahn/mj-iot)), it's been a few years ago and I
naturally forgot most of the things, even the basics.

Anyway, since I need Angular again for one of the projects that I'm working on,
I had to pick it up again, and as a result, an [Angular
Series](/programming/angular/components) was born. I'm still working on it,
especially on the [NgRx](/programming/angular/ngrx) bits, but the whole thing is
at around 90% level of completion. I already see myself going back to some parts
of it as I'm starting to use Angular, which proves that it's useful. I hope it
will be useful for you as well.

I have to admit that I was very Vue-focused in the last years, and I didn't
think I'd be ever switching to anything else. I'm not so sure anymore! Angular
is definitely more involved, it requires you to write more boilerplate code
(it's changing with [Standalone
Components](/programming/angular/standalone-components/)!), but it's also very
well structured and it kind of reminds me a bit of ASP.NET Core's way of doing
things.

For small quick projects I'd probably stick with Vue.js, but for bigger ones,
Angular could be a great alternative.
