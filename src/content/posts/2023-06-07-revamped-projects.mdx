title: Revamped Projects Section

One of the sections of this site is [Projects](/projects). Initially,
it had a very similar structure to the rest of the website - a sidebar on
the left, listing some of my projects, and the actual content about the
projects on the right. Recently, I started to think about improving that
sections, due to the following reasons:

-   all of my projects are on GitHub, so maybe it would make sense
    to pull some metadata from there to make the view on them here more
    attractive
-   again, all of my projects are on GitHub, so why would I duplicate
    the contents of README files as part of this website? Updating any README
    requires me to update it here as well

The result is a revamped [Projects](/projects) section. Its features are:

- projects are presented as clickable tiles (that take you to GitHub)
- projects' titles, descriptions, programming language icon, and star counters
  are data pulled from GitHub using its API (I used
  [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit))
- some projects have downloads counters. Projects with that characteristic are
  only those that are being distributed via some kind of store/package
  repository. In my case, I implemented services that pull that kind of data
  from: [npm](https://npmjs.com), [crates.io](https://crates.io), [Gnome
  Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org), [Chrome Web
  Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore), [Edge
  Addons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/).
- projects' data gets refreshed only during builds, to keep the client-side code
  as light as possible. To keep the data relatively up-to-date, I added a
  cron-based trigger to my [GitHub
  Action](https://github.com/marcinjahn/technology-notebook/blob/main/.github/workflows/deployToGithubPages.yml),
  so that the data is refreshed everyday, in addition to builds on push.

Projects being displayed are still hand-selected, since displaying ALL of
the stuff from GitHub would bring a lot of trash, which even I don't want
to look at.
