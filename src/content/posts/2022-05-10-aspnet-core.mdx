ASP.NET Core is such a fundamental technology in the projects that I work on
that I decided to write an overview of it. In the process, I have looked into
the parts that I do not normally utilize (like [Razor
Pages](/programming/dotnet/asp-net-core/razor-pages/)). It was an interesting
journey that helped me to put my knowledge of the ASP.NET Core framework in
order. My main interest in the ASP.NET Core land has always been the [Web
APIs](/programming/dotnet/asp-net-core/web-apis) and most of the knowledge in my
article series is applicable to that.

You can find the articles
[here](/programming/dotnet/asp-net-core/overview).
