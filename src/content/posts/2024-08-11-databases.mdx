Recently I've been adding some content on databases to my website.
There already was some content on specific database products, like:

- [Microsoft SQL Server](/technologies/sql-server)
- [MongoDB](/technologies/mongodb/mongo-overview)
- [elasticsearch](/technologies/elasticsearch/overview)

but I was missing some general facts on things that are common among databases
in general. If you think about it, there's quite a lot of topics that any
database engine has to take care of. These are things such as:

- trancastions
- indexing
- partitioning and sharding
- ...

As a result, a bunch of articles have been added under the [Databases](/technologies/databases/acid)
node. I know it's gonna be useful to me, as a refresher, and I hope
it'll be useful to you as well.
