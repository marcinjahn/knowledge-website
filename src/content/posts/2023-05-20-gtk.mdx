Lately I've been playing around with the [GTK toolkit](https://www.gtk.org/),
especially in the context of using it together with [GJS](https://gjs.guide)
to create Linux GUI apps with JavaScript (or preferably TypeScript). As usually,
when learning something new, I've done some notes. They are available for anyone
interested [right here](/programming/gtk/overview/). It should give you
a general overview of what GTK is, and what it consists of. It also
gives a brief introduction into how to use it with JavaScript.

I found that one of the easiest way to develop GTK apps is by creating
Gnome Shell extensions. Here're a couple of them that I've authored:

- [Quick Settings Audio Devices Hider](https://github.com/marcinjahn/gnome-quicksetings-audio-devices-hider-extension)
- [Quick Settings Aduio Devices Renamer](https://github.com/marcinjahn/gnome-quicksetings-audio-devices-renamer-extension)
- [Do Not Disturb While Screen Sharing or Recording](https://github.com/marcinjahn/gnome-do-not-disturb-while-screen-sharing-or-recording-extension)
- [Dim Completed Calendar Events](https://github.com/marcinjahn/gnome-dim-completed-calendar-events-extension)

The first two extensions were even highlighted on [OMG!
Ubuntu](https://omgubuntu.co.uk)
([Renamer](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/06/rename-audio-devices-gnomes-quick-settings),
[Hider](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/05/hide-audio-devices-gnome-quick-settings)),
which was really cool to see.
