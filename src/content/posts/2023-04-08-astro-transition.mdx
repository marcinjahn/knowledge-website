title: Transition to Astro

This website has been running on [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) (v1)
since its inception. Even though it has been serving me pretty well, it was not
perfect. First of all, VuePress websites are actually SPA (Single Page Apps).
This has quite a big impact on the website performance, due to lost (and lots!)
of JavaScript being involved. It's alright on more app-like sites, where lots of
interactivity is needed. This is not one of these sites. It's a content-focused
website where interactivity is limited to the minimum. That's where frameworks
like [Astro](https://astro.build) come in. Astro puts a big focus on performance
of the generated website, and it does it by resolving most of the JS during
build time, or via Server Side Rendering. 

I've been eyeing Astro since quite some time, and when it hit version 2, I
decided to give it a try by transitioning this very website from VuePress to
Astro. The process went rather smoothly, here are a few of the things that I
had to take care of in the process:

- building my own "core" components, like navbar, sideabar, tip boxes, or even
  hamburger menu - VuePress would come with that functionality built-in, Astro
  does not.
- code syntax highlighting - while VuePress would come with a quite nice
  out-of-the-box configuration of syntax highlighting, Astro has just the
  default "coloring" of code syntax. The thing that I missed was specific lines
  highlighting. That required me to create custom component that would handle
  that.
- recreating the theme of my site - I had it coded into VuePress, mangled in
  between the VuePress provided, now I had to opportunity to clean it up. I
  consider the process to be ongoing though, as I plan to transition it to
  Tailwind CSS.

One of the coolest features of Astro is [Content
Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/). It allows
to "model" the content splitting it into different kinds (in my case it's
"articles" and "posts" (like this one)). Each kind of content can be attributed
by its own (TypeScript typed metadata). It allows fetch the content together
with its metadata, and operate on it in various ways. That feature was quite
useful when building component such as a Sidebar.

Finishing up, Astro is awesome, and if you have a need to create a static
website with focus on content, I'd suggest you give it a try.
