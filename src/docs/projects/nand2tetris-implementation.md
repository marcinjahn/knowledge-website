# Nand2tetris Implementation in .NET

The wonderful [nand2tetris project](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) is the best
free online course I have ever found. It teaches you about the fundamentals of
modern computers. The topics include:

- logic gates
- CPU
- assembler
- VM-based languages
- compilators

The course is practical, the students are encouraged to build the system as they
go. The work includes the creation of an assembler, a VM translator, and a
compiler (for the Hack and Jack languages).

While I was going throught the course myself, I had implemented the following:

- [Hack language assembler](https://github.com/marcinjahn/Hack.Assembler)
- [Hack VM Translator](https://github.com/marcinjahn/Hack.VMTranslator)
- [Jack Compiler](https://github.com/marcinjahn/Hack.JackCompiler)
- [Jack Programs Examples](https://github.com/marcinjahn/Hack.JackPrograms)

The projects were done in .NET C# with OOP practices in mind.
