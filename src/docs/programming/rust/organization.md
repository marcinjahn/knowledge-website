# Organization

Rust has a number of features that allow to manage codeâ€™s organization,
including which details are exposed, which details are private, and what names
are in each scope in programs. These features, sometimes collectively referred
to as the module system, include:

- **Crates**: a binary or library
- **Packages**: one or more crates that provide a set of functionality. A
  package contains a `Cargo.toml` file
- **Modules**: let us organize code within a crate into groups for readability
  and easy reuse
- **Paths**: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module

## Packages

A package contains crates. It can be as many binary crates as needed and just
one library crate.
We create packages with `cargo new my-project-name`.

## Modules

Modules control encapsulation. Some items might be *public*, others can be
*private*. Modules may be nested.

Example:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
  mod hosting {
    fn add_to_waitlist() {}

    fn seat_at_table() {}
  }

  mod serving {
    fn take_order() {}

    fn serve_order() {}

    fn take_payment() {}
  }
}
```

Modules may contain definitions of anything (modules, functions, structs, enums,
etc.).
