# Who Am I?

My name is Marcin Jahn. I am a technology evangelist/developer/tech enthusiast
from Łódź, Poland. I am an automation and robotics engineer by education - but
frankly, I hate working with robots, I much prefer software development (not for
robots though :P). I am interested in all computer things, but my main
activities are in the following areas:

- cloud
- IoT
- containerization
- linux
- frontend development
- backend development

These are just some key words that come to my mind at the moment. The world of
IT is so huge (end expanding all the time) that it's quite hard to encompass the
technology landscape that we're dealing with today with just a couple words.
However, looking at the list I think it summarizes quite well what I'm doing
most of the time in front of a computer.

Here're a few technologies/products, called out by name, that I use and have some expertise in:

- **cloud**:
  - [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) - I have years of
    experience with Microsoft's cloud offerings. During my work I've been mostly
    dealing with App Services (Web Apps, Functions, Logic Apps), container
    offerings (Container Instances, AKS), databases and storage in general
    (CosmosDB, Storage Table, Storage Queue), IoT Hub, DPS, and many other
    services that I used together to build various systems. Regarding
    certification, I have the following certificates:
      - [Azure
        Fundamentals](https://www.credly.com/badges/b848fcd6-4168-4c47-bd47-0bd3048cb3fc)
      - [Azure Developer
        Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/4a6fd0b9-aad8-40cf-ba56-a0e741670c2a?source=linked_in_profile)
      - [Azure Solutions Architect
        Expert](https://www.credly.com/badges/7212a5f3-6fed-43b4-8957-b892d1129216)
- **IoT**:
  - [Azure IoT
    Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/) - I started using
    it while working on my master thesis to build my own IoT Platform. I also use it extensively at work
  - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) - this small PC is a perfect
    harware for experimentation in varios IT areas. I used it as an IoT device.
- **containerization**:
  - [OCI containers](https://opencontainers.org/about/overview/) - using
    [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) is
    nowadays a standard way to build and run applications, especially in the
    cloud. Most of the applications I build end up as container images.
  - [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) - an amazing initative to standardize
    the way we deploy apps across cloud providers. Nowadays I prefer deploying
    my apps there than using things like [Azure
    Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) or other
    SaaS solutions that were my preferred choice in the past. Regarding the
    actual cloud offering, I rely on [Azure Kuebrnetes
    Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/).
    Btw, this website is hosted on K8s as well!
- **linux**:
  - [Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/) - the operating
    system that I use on my main PC. It's a perfect tool for software
    development work. I think that working on a Linux-based OS makes it much
    easier to build applications that in the end will be running on Linux as
    well (probably in containers).
  - [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) - a great Linux distribution that is
    very transparent and easy to get into by developers. I plan to get back to
    it in the future, currently Fedora occupies my disk.
  - [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) - in my opinion it's the most modern,
    pretty, and future-ready Linux DE that is out there at the moment. Second
    best is Pantheon of [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/).
- **frontend development**:
  - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - my favourite JavaScript framework. I find it
    the easiest to learn and use among the big three (Angular, React, Vue),
    which I all had experience with in the past.
  - [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) - an obvious choise of a static site
    generator for Vue.js enthusiasts. It's just easy to use, and easy to extend.
    This website is built on VuePress as well.
- **backend development**:
  - [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) - the first programming language
    that I really got into and used professionally. Although nowadays I prefer a
    bit more "felxible" languages, like
    [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), I find .NET to be much more
    reliable and it's my choice for bigger applications.
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - I've had a bit of a love-and-hate
    relationship with that technology. The flexibility of JS used to be a weird
    idea for me in the past. Later I started to appreciate that. I find Node to
    be a perfect tool for smaller applications or PoC/demo needs. It definitely
    can be used for bigger apps as well, but I just did not use it for such
    cases yet.
