My name is Marcin Jahn, I am a technology evangelist. I work at ABB with the ABB
Ability Platform where I mostly deal with the Industrial Internet of Things
(IIoT) related topics. You can find out more about me [here](/meta/who-am-i.md).

This page is supposed to be a place for various IT topics that I felt the need
to write down. Some of the topics might be described in a great detail, while
some others might contain just a few lines of information, depending on my
interest in a given topic or personal need to actually write it down. I treat it
as my personal notepad, thus the content might not be very useful for anyone
else than me. However, if you do find it worth a read, that's great! You can
find out more about this website [here](/meta/this-website.md).
