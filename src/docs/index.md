My name is [Marcin Jahn](/about/who-am-i.md), I am a software engineer and
technology enthusiast. Welcome to my notebook!

This website is a place for various IT topics that I felt the need to write
down. If you find any of the contents useful, that's great! You can find
out more about how this website was built (and why)
[here](/about/this-website.md).

Some of the publications:

- [ASP.NET
Core
series](/programming/dotnet/asp-net-core/overview.md)
- [Entity Framework Core](/programming/dotnet/entity-framework-core/)
- [Rust series](/programming/rust/overview.md)
- [Kubernetes
series](/technologies/kubernetes/meaning.md)
- [Helm](/technologies/kubernetes/helm.md)
