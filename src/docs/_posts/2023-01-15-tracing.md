# Tracing

I've added an article about one of the pillars of Observability in modern
distributed cloud systems - Tracing. Tracing is nowadays a part of the
OpenTelemetry standard, it's the part of the standard that is the most stable
and well-defined. Tools like Jaeger alrady implement the standard, so it's the
right time to jump on board, and start tracing out apps using OpenTelemetry
SDKs. You can find the article [here](../technologies/observability/tracing.md).
