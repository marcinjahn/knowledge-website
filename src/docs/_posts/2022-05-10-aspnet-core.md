# ASP.NET Core Materials

ASP.NET Core is such a fundamental technology in the projects that I work on
that I decided to write an overview of it. I looked into parts that I do not use
(like [Razor Pages](../programming/dotnet/asp-net-core/razor-pages.md)).
Although I do not have (currently) any plans to utilize that, it was an
interesting journey discovering that "sub-framework" nevertheless. My main
interest in the ASP.NET Core land has always been the [Web
APIs](../programming/dotnet/asp-net-core/web-apis.md) and most of the knowledge
in my article series is applicable to that.

You can find the articles
[here](../programming/dotnet/asp-net-core/overview.md).
