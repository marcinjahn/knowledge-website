# Overview of Rust

There seems to be a lot of hype around Rust recently. Especially in the Linux
community, Rust seems to gaining popularity. One of the reasons for it is the
GTK 4 toolkit and an unofficial [gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/) bindings for it.

I wanted to explore why that language became so popular, so I decided to learn
it, at least on a beginner level. The lessons I've learnt have been noted in the
[Rust Series](../programming/rust/basics.md).

I've purchased the [Rust in
Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action) from Manning. I got so
used to high quality of Manning publications that this book caused a bit of a
shock for me. Somehow I could not get through it, it seemed to me like the
author was delivering the content out of order, and it was just unbearable for
me. I stopped in the middle, and picked the [official Rust
book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). I have to admit, it's one of the best
programming books I've ever read.

If you want to learn Rust, I suggest that you go through the [Rust
Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). My content is a brief summary of that
book.
