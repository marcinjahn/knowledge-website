# Angular Content

I've been studying Angular for a few weeks now. Although I've used this
technology in the past numerous times (e.g., in my [master
thesis](../projects/mjiot.md)), it's been a few years ago and I naturally forgot
most of the things, even the basics.

Anyway, since I need Angular again for one of the projects that I'm working on,
I had to pick it up again, and as a result, an [Angular
Series](../programming/angular/components.md) was born. I'm still working on it,
especially on the [NgRx](../programming/angular/ngrx.md) bits, but the whole
thing is at around 90% level of completion. I already see myself going back to
some parts of it as I'm starting to use Angular, which proves that it's useful.
I hope it will be useful for you as well :)
