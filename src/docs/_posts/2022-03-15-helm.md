# Helm

Kubernetes is such a commonly used technology nowadays that various tooling and
solutions have been born around it. One of them is [Helm](https://helm.sh/). In
one of the projects I've been working on professionally, I had to make use of
Helm. Well, I didn't really have to, but it turned out to be the easiest
solution. A part of my task was to deploy WordPress onto a K8s cluster.
Solution offered by [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/stack/wordpress) was so simple
that I decided to dig a bit deeper into Helm. As a result, I packaged another
app with Helm making its deployment easier. An additional result is an [Overview
of Helm](../technologies/kubernetes/helm.md) that I've written. I know I will be
getting back to it anytime I need to use Helm. Hopefully, you will find it useful
as well.
